  abstract = {The concepts of niche conservatism and adaptive radiation have played central roles in the study of evolution and ecological diversification. With respect to phenotypic evolution, the two processes may be seen as opposite ends of a spectrum; however, there is no straightforward method for the comparative analysis of trait evolution that will identify these contrasting scenarios. Analysis of the rate of phenotypic evolution plays an important role in this context and merits increased attention. In this article, independent contrasts are used to estimate rates of evolution for continuous traits under a Brownian motion model of evolution. A unit for the rate of phenotypic diversification is introduced: the felsen, in honor of J. Felsenstein, is defined as an increase of one unit per million years in the variance among sister taxa of ln-transformed trait values. The use of a standardized unit of measurement facilitates comparisons among clades and traits. Rates of diversification of three functional traits (plant height, leaf size, and seed size) were estimated for four to six woody plant clades (Acer, Aesculus, Ceanothus, Arbutoideae, Hawaiian lobeliads, and the silversword alliance) for which calibrated phylogenies were available. For height and leaf size, rates were two to {$\approx$}300 times greater in the Hawaiian silversword alliance than in the other clades considered. These results highlight the value of direct estimates of rates of trait evolution for comparative analysis of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and trait diversification.},

  abstract = {Aim In the face of global environmental change, identifying the factors that shape the ecological niches of species and understanding the mechanisms behind them can help to draft effective conservation plans. The differences in the ecological factors that shape species distributions may then help to highlight differences between closely related taxa. We investigate the applicability of ecological niche modelling and the comparison of species distributions in ecological niche space to detect areas with priority for biodiversity conservation and to analyse differences in the ecological niche spaces used by closely related taxa. Location United States of America, Mexico and Central America. Methods We apply ordination and ecological niche modelling techniques to assess the main environmental drivers of the distribution of Mexican white pines (Pinus: Pinaceae). Furthermore, we assess the similarities and differences of the ecological niches occupied by closely related taxa. We analyse whether Mexican white pines occupy similar or equivalent ecological niches. Results All the studied taxa presented different responses to the environmental factors, resulting in a unique combination of niche conditions. Our stacked habitat suitability maps highlighted regions in southern Mexico and northern Central America as highly suitable for most species and thus with high conservation value. By quantitatively assessing the niche overlap, similarity and equivalency of Mexican white pines, our results prove that the distribution of one species cannot be implied by the distribution of another, even if these taxa are considered closely related. Main conclusions The fact that each Mexican white pine is constrained by a unique set of environmental conditions, and thus, their non-equivalence of ecological niches has direct implications for conservation as this highlights the inadequacy of one-fits all type of conservation measure.},

  abstract = {The idea that tropical forest and savanna are alternative states is crucial to how we manage these biomes and predict their future under global change. Large-scale empirical evidence for alternative stable states is limited, however, and comes mostly from the multimodal distribution of structural aspects of vegetation. These approaches have been criticized, as structure alone cannot separate out wetter savannas from drier forests for example, and there are also technical challenges to mapping vegetation structure in unbiased ways. Here, we develop an alternative approach to delimit the climatic envelope of the two biomes in Africa using tree species lists gathered for a large number of forest and savanna sites distributed across the continent. Our analyses confirm extensive climatic overlap of forest and savanna, supporting the alternative stable states hypothesis for Africa, and this result is corroborated by paleoecological evidence. Further, we find the two biomes to have highly divergent tree species compositions and to represent alternative compositional states. This allowed us to classify tree species as forest vs. savanna specialists, with some generalist species that span both biomes. In conjunction with georeferenced herbarium records, we mapped the forest and savanna distributions across Africa and quantified their environmental limits, which are primarily related to precipitation and seasonality, with a secondary contribution of fire. These results are important for the ongoing efforts to restore African ecosystems, which depend on accurate biome maps to set appropriate targets for the restored states but also provide empirical evidence for broad-scale bistability.},

  abstract = {Broadleaved evergreen sclerophyllous taxa occupied a subhumid belt across much of North America-Eurasia by the middle Eocene. They originated from alliances in older laurophyllous forests that adapted to spreading dry climate. Since the continued trend to aridity finally restricted sclerophyllous vegetation to subhumid areas separated by drier tracts, it now occurs in areas with summer rain as well as in summer-dry mediterranean climates. Taxa of chaparral and macchia habit are common undershrubs in sclerophyll woodlands, to which they are seral. Shrublands spread only recently, though the adaptive structural features of the taxa are ancient and probably not pyrogenic. The history of Madrean-Tethyan sclerophyll vegetation illuminates three biogeographic problems. First, related taxa that link the Mediterranean-California areas are part of the larger problem of ties between these areas and those of summer rainfall, of taxa now in summer-rain areas that were in presently summer-dry areas into the early Pleistocene, and of the more numerous taxa that linked sclerophyllous vegetation of the Madrean-Tethyan regions during the Tertiary. The ties between summer-dry and summer-wet areas are relicts of the Neogene; taxa now in mediterranean-climate areas adapted functionally to these new climates during the Pleistocene; and most trans-Atlantic links owe to migration across a narrower ocean with more numerous islands, to a broader zone of subhumid climate, and to a more easterly trending Appalachian axis with numerous dry edaphic sites. Second, by the mid-Oligocene spreading dry climate had confined a formerly continuous temperate rainforest to southern Mexico, the West coast and the Appalachian area. Winter cold and summer drought exterminated it in the West, whereas in the East winter cold eliminated most evergreen dicots, leaving a dominantly deciduous hardwood forest there. The temperate "Appalachian disjuncts" in southern Mexico are therefore ancient, and did not migrate south to enter a forest previously without deciduous hardwoods, as others maintain. Third, the Canarian laurel forest derived its taxa from those in laurophyllous forests that covered northern Africa into the middle Miocene, not by southward migration from southern Europe in the Pliocene. Since many shrubs in the surviving laurel forest also contribute to macchia on bordering slopes, the ancient origin of their typical adaptive structural features is clearly implied.}

  abstract = {The classification of the legume family proposed here addresses the long-known non-monophyly of the traditionally recognised subfamily Caesalpinioideae, by recognising six robustly supported monophyletic subfamilies. This new classification uses as its framework the most comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of legumes to date, based on plastid matK gene sequences, and including near-complete sampling of genera (698 of the currently recognised 765 genera) and ca. 20\% (3696) of known species. The matK gene region has been the most widely sequenced across the legumes, and in most legume lineages, this gene region is sufficiently variable to yield well-supported clades. This analysis resolves the same major clades as in other phylogenies of whole plastid and nuclear gene sets (with much sparser taxon sampling). Our analysis improves upon previous studies that have used large phylogenies of the Leguminosae for addressing evolutionary questions, because it maximises generic sampling and provides a phylogenetic tree that is based on a fully curated set of sequences that are vouchered and taxonomically validated. The phylogenetic trees obtained and the underlying data are available to browse and download, facilitating subsequent analyses that require evolutionary trees. Here we propose a new community-endorsed classification of the family that reflects the phylogenetic structure that is consistently resolved and recognises six subfamilies in Leguminosae: a recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae DC., Cercidoideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), Detarioideae Burmeist., Dialioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), Duparquetioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), and Papilionoideae DC. The traditionally recognised subfamily Mimosoideae is a distinct clade nested within the recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae and is referred to informally as the mimosoid clade pending a forthcoming formal tribal and/or cladebased classification of the new Caesalpinioideae. We provide a key for subfamily identification, descriptions with diagnostic charactertistics for the subfamilies, figures illustrating their floral and fruit diversity, and lists of genera by subfamily. This new classification of Leguminosae represents a consensus view of the international legume systematics community; it invokes both compromise and practicality of use.},

Here we study the phylogenetics of the group using nucleotide sequences from ribosomal ITS, four low-copy nuclear genes and four plastid regions. We find poorly resolved gene trees typical of closely related species, but most species are resolved as monophyletic, and we report conflicting phylogenetic placements only for D. brachycarpa and C. racemosa. A time-calibrated biogeographical analysis of the concatenated matrix of all nine loci suggests that the ancestral area of the Delonix, Lemuropisum and Colvillea clade was in southwestern Madagascar c. 24\textendash 18 Ma. An out-of-Madagascar dispersal to Africa took place during the Miocene, most likely by vegetative rafting. Delonix is not monophyletic due to the robustly supported placement of L. edule in Delonix, warranting treatment of Lemuropisum as congeneric with Delonix and establishment of the new name combination Delonix edule, in line with the close morphological similarities between these two genera. In contrast, the phylogenetic position of C. racemosa is unstable occurring in the Delonix\textendash Lemuropisum clade in the nuclear gene trees, but sister to this clade in the plastid gene tree. The status of Colvillea as a distinct genus, therefore , remains questionable, but it is here maintained based on a suite of morphological distinctions, pending further insights into the relationships of this elusive genus.}

The abundance of climbers was surveyed in gaps standardized for light conditions. The results are compared with the abundance of climbers in the disjunct Alexandria Forest. 2. Climber abundance was found to be positively correlated with the altitudinal gradient as well as with the level of base nutrients in the soil but not with the nitrogen concentration. However, these factors together with rainfall may covary and thus confound any power to explain the distribution of climbers. 3. The hypothesis that climber abundance is limited by trellis availability, i.e. the presence of small-diameter branches, and thus host-tree architecture and crown characteristics, was tested. The results suggest that the presence of trellises is important in determining the distribution of climbers. Where the forest canopy is high, and small-diameter branches (trellises) are scarce, significantly more climbers enter their host trees horizontally from neighbouring trees than vertically, whereas when the forest is low more climbers enter their host trees vertically via the available trellises. The density of climbers per host tree is correlated with the height of the lowest branches of the tree canopy. The trunk of trees is seldom used as an access route for climbers to the canopy of their host trees. 4. The distribution and abundance of climbers is probably determined by biotic factors, in particular the architecture of host trees, rather than by climatic or soil factors.},

  abstract = {Abstract The monophyletic tribe Cercideae is one of the earliest branching lineages in Leguminosae, sister to the rest of the family. It is a highly varied and complex group which has undergone many taxonomic re-organisations, and is currently the subject of further systematic studies. The pollen of the Cercideae has long been known to be diverse and varied, but problematic species and generic delimitations have previously hindered our understanding of the similarities, differences, evolution and taxonomic significance of the various pollen structures found within the tribe. This study aims to better understand the complexities of the pollen morphological variation by assessing them with regard to recent phylogenetic studies, and also to provide pollen characters that will help to gain more resolution in systematic studies. Approximately 250 pollen samples from tribe Cercideae were studied using light as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy, with 58 of those samples taken from 55 species of 12 genera matching those analysed in a recent molecular phylogeny. The distribution of morphological structures is examined by mapping them onto a recently published molecular phylogenetic tree. Using the molecular phylogeny to show pollen diversity and distribution, we provide an overview of pollen morphology in the Cercideae. The first branching lineages in tribe Cercideae have an unspecialised pollen type, whereas the more variable and distinct pollen types are found in the more derived lineages, in Schnella, Lasiobema, Phanera and Bauhinia s.str. There is a high degree of specialisation in surface ornamentation, wall structure and aperture type in these groups when compared to other caesalpinioid taxa. The Cercideae is currently the subject of much research. This overview of pollen structure presents a summary of the distribution of pollen morphological variation, providing data which allows the structural variation in pollen to be compared and contrasted in evolutionary and taxonomic contexts. It also provides potential autapomorphic and synapomorphic palynological characters of use in phylogenetic analyses and taxonomy.}

  abstract = {Pollen grains of 250 samples of taxa in the Cercideae clade have been studied using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This study examines how pollen morphological structures can be used as taxonomic characters in systematic studies. Pollen grains of the first branching taxa in the Cercideae phylogeny, such as Cercis and Adenolobus, are unspecialised; they are isopolar, tectate, tricolporate, and released in monads. Surface ornamentation may be micro-reticulate or perforate, and psilate to rugulate. Aperture membranes are granular to coarsely granular. More specialised pollen grain structures are found in Schnella, Lasiobema, Phanera, Piliostigma and most of Bauhinia s.s. Pollen morphology is presented in a table for comparative purposes and illustrated, discussed and compared. Six specialised pollen structures described and identified are diagnostic for groups of related species in the Cercideae. These include a granular infratectum, syncolporate apertures, pororate apertures, spiny opercula, tetrads, and non-supratectal spines. Porate apertures occur in Phanera, Piliostigma and Bauhinia picta. Five pollen structures have been identified within the Cercideae clade that is restricted to Bauhinia s.s. These include striate ornamentation, having more than three apertures per grain, apertures that are indistinct, and colpate apertures. Supratectal ornamentation, structures such as gemmae, verrucae and striae, occur in many species in the Cercideae, as well as throughout subfamily Caesalpinioideae, and the functional implications of this are discussed. Pollen morphological structures are discussed with regard to systematic significance, taxonomic utility, and in relation to functional and developmental considerations.},

Although these models have proved useful in a variety of contexts, they still do not cover all the scenarios biologists want to examine. For models based on the OU process, model complexity is restricted in current implementations by assuming that the rate of stochastic motion and the strength of selection do not vary among selective regimes. Here, we expand the OU model of adaptive evolution to include models that variously relax the assumption of a constant rate and strength of selection. In its most general form, the methods described here can assign each selective regime a separate trait optimum, a rate of stochastic motion parameter, and a parameter for the strength of selection. We use simulations to show that our models can detect meaningful differences in the evolutionary process, especially with larger sample sizes. We also illustrate our method using an empirical example of genome size evolution within a large flowering plant clade.},

This mixed grass\textendash tree biome rapidly appeared on the ecological stage 8 million years ago with the near-synchronous expansion of C4 grasses around the world. We propose a new hypothesis for this global event based on a systems analysis that integrates recent advances in how fire influences cloud microphysics, climate and savanna ecology in a low carbon dioxide (CO2) world. We show that fire accelerates forest loss and C4 grassland expansion through multiple positive feedback loops that each promote drought and more fire. A low CO2 atmosphere amplifies this cycle by limiting tree recruitment, allowing the ingress of C4 grasses to greatly increase ecosystem flammability. Continued intensification of land use could enhance or moderate the network of feedbacks that have initiated, promoted and sustained savannas for millions of years. We suggest these alterations will overprint the effects of anthropogenic atmospheric change in coming decades.},

  abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal {$\alpha$}= 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\% of traits) and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

Recent statistical methods have been developed that free us from these limitations enabling us to overcome the problems of parsimony by accommodating uncertainty in evolutionary time, ancestral states, and the phylogeny. Results: SIMMAP has been developed to implement stochastic character mapping that is useful to both molecular evolutionists, systematists, and bioinformaticians. Researchers can address questions about positive selection, patterns of amino acid substitution, character association, and patterns of morphological evolution. Conclusion: Stochastic character mapping, as implemented in the SIMMAP software, enables users to address questions that require mapping characters onto phylogenies using a probabilistic approach that does not rely on parsimony. Analyses can be performed using a fully Bayesian approach that is not reliant on considering a single topology, set of substitution model parameters, or reconstruction of ancestral states. Uncertainty in these quantities is accommodated by using MCMC samples from their respective posterior distributions.},

Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago.

Species also competed more with close relatives than with distant relatives in field soils; however, in potting soil this pattern reversed, and close relatives might even have more mutalistic relationships than distant relatives in these soils. Our results suggest that niche conservatism (habitat filtering) and species interactions (competition or facilitation) structure community composition, that phylogenetic relationships influence the strength of species' interactions, and that conserved aspects of plant niches include soil attributes.},

As a result these two groups of woody species will have different spatial distributions: lianas are more common in high light environments. This study determines the differences in growth patterns, biomass allocation and leaf traits in five closely related liana and tree species of the genus Bauhinia.Seedlings of two light-demanding lianas (Bauhinia tenuiflora and B. claviflora), one shade-tolerant liana (B. aurea), and two light-demanding trees (B. purpurea and B. monandra) were grown in a shadehouse at 25 \% of full sunlight. A range of physiological, morphological and biomass parameters at the leaf and whole plant level were compared among these five species.The two light-demanding liana species had higher relative growth rate (RGR), allocated more biomass to leaf production [higher leaf mass fraction (LMF) and higher leaf area ratio (LAR)] and stem mass fraction (SMF), and less biomass to the roots [root mass fraction (RMF)] than the two tree species. The shade-tolerant liana had the lowest RGR of all five species, and had a higher RMF, lower SMF and similar LMF than the two light-demanding liana species. The two light-demanding lianas had lower photosynthetic rates per unit area (Aarea) and similar photosynthetic rates per unit mass (Amass) than the trees. Across species, RGR was positively related to SLA, but not to LAR and Aarea.It is concluded that the faster growth of light-demanding lianas compared with light-demanding trees is based on morphological parameters (SLA, LMF and LAR), and cannot be attributed to higher photosynthetic rates at the leaf level. The shade-tolerant liana exhibited a slow-growth strategy, compared with the light-demanding species.},

Previous work has established that a WGD affects most lineages in the Papilionoideae and occurred sometime after the divergence of the papilionoid and mimosoid clades, but the exact timing has been unknown. The history of WGD has also not been established for legume lineages outside the Papilionoideae. We investigated the presence and timing of WGDs in the legumes by querying thousands of phylogenetic trees constructed from transcriptome and genome data from 20 diverse legumes and 17 outgroup species. The timing of duplications in the gene trees indicates that the papilionoid WGD occurred in the common ancestor of all papilionoids. The earliest diverging lineages of the Papilionoideae include both nodulating taxa, such as the genistoids (e.g., lupin), dalbergioids (e.g., peanut), phaseoloids (e.g., beans), and galegoids (=Hologalegina, e.g., clovers), and clades with nonnodulating taxa including Xanthocercis and Cladrastis (evaluated in this study). We also found evidence for several independent WGDs near the base of other major legume lineages, including the Mimosoideae\textendash Cassiinae\textendash Caesalpinieae (MCC), Detarieae, and Cercideae clades. Nodulation is found in the MCC and papilionoid clades, both of which experienced ancestral WGDs. However, there are numerous nonnodulating lineages in both clades, making it unclear whether the phylogenetic distribution of nodulation is due to independent gains or a single origin followed by multiple losses.},

  abstract = {The frequency of evolutionary biome shifts during diversification has important implications for our ability to explain geographic patterns of plant diversity. Recent studies present several examples of biome shifts, but whether frequencies of biome shifts closely reflect geographic proximity or environmental similarity of biomes remains poorly known. We explore this question by using phylogenomic methods to estimate the phylogeny of Hakea, a diverse Australian genus occupying a wide range of biomes. Model-based estimation of ancestral regions indicates that Hakea began diversifying in the Mediterranean biome of southern Australia in the Middle Eocene\textendash Early Oligocene, and dispersed repeatedly into other biomes across the continent. We infer around 47 shifts between biomes. Frequencies of shifts between pairs of biomes are usually similar to those expected from their geographic connectedness or climatic similarity, but in some cases are substantially higher or lower than expected, perhaps reflecting how readily key physiological traits can be modified to adapt lineages to new environments. The history of frequent biome-shifting is reflected in the structure of present-day assemblages, which tend to be more phylogenetically diverse than null-model expectations. The case of Hakea demonstrates that the radiation of large plant clades across wide geographic areas need not be constrained by dispersal limitation or conserved adaptations to particular environments.},

We introduce a novel approach to biome delimitation and mapping, based upon combining individual regionalizations derived from floristic, functional, and phylogenetic data linked to environmentally trained species distribution models. We define ``core Biomes'' as areas where independent regionalizations agree and ``transition zones'' as those whose biome identity is not corroborated by all analyses. We apply this approach to delimiting the neglected Caatinga seasonally dry tropical forest biome in northeast Brazil. We delimit the ``core Caatinga'' as a smaller and more climatically limited area than previous definitions, and argue it represents a floristically, functionally, and phylogenetically coherent unit within the driest parts of northeast Brazil. ``Caatinga transition zones'' represent a large and biologically important area, highlighting that ecological and evolutionary processes work across environmental gradients and that biomes are not categorical variables. We discuss the differences among individual regionalizations in an ecological and evolutionary context and the potential limitations and utility of individual and combined biome delimitations. Our integrated ecological and evolutionary definition of the Caatinga and associated transition zones are argued to best describe and map biologically meaningful biomes.},

  abstract = {Savannas first began to spread across Africa during the Miocene. A major hypothesis for explaining this vegetation change is the increase in C4 grasses, promoting fire. We investigated whether mammals could also have contributed to savanna expansion by using spinescence as a marker of mammal herbivory. Looking at the present distribution of 1,852 tree species, we established that spinescence is mainly associated with two functional types of mammals: large browsers and medium-sized mixed feeders. Using a dated phylogeny for the same tree species, we found that spinescence evolved at least 55 times. The diversification of spiny plants occurred long after the evolution of Afrotherian proboscideans and hyracoids. However, it is remarkably congruent with diversification of bovids, the lineage including the antelope that predominantly browse these plants today. Our findings suggest that herbivore-adapted savannas evolved several million years before fire-maintained savannas and probably, in different environmental conditions. Spiny savannas with abundant mammal herbivores occur in drier climates and on nutrient-rich soils, whereas fire-maintained savannas occur in wetter climates on nutrient-poor soils.},

  abstract = {For much of the last thirty years, the caesalpinioid genus Bauhinia has been recognised by numerous authors as a broadly circumscribed, ecologically, morphologically and palynologically diverse pantropical taxon, comprising several subgenera. One of these, Bauhinia subg. Phanera has recently been reinstated at generic rank based on a synthesis of morphological and molecular data. Nevertheless, there remains considerable diversity within Phanera. Following a review of palynological and molecular studies of Phanera in conjunction with a careful re-examination of the morphological heterogeneity within the genus, we have found strong evidence that the species of Phanera subsect. Corymbosae are a natural group that warrant generic status. We describe here the genus Cheniella R.Clark \& Mackinder gen. nov. to accommodate them. It comprises 10 species and 3 subspecies, one newly described here. Generic characters include leaves that are simple and emarginate or bilobed; flowers with elongate hypanthia which are as long as or much longer than the sepals; pods that are glabrous, compressed, oblong, indehiscent or tardily dehiscent; and with numerous seeds, the seeds bearing an unusually long funicle extending most of the way around their circumference. A further distinctive floral character was found to be a fleshy disc on which the staminodes are mounted. An analysis carried out for this study reveals Cheniella to be characterised by a pollen type that is unique to the genus and previously unknown in the Leguminosae. Species diversity is richest in southern China, the full distribution extending westward to India and south- and eastward through Indochina into Malesia.},

In reality, the major tropical rain forest regions, in tropical America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and New Guinea, have as many differences as similarities, as a result of their isolation from each other during the evolution of their floras and faunas. This new edition reinforces this message with new examples from recent and on-going research. After an introduction to the environments and geological histories of the major rain forest regions, subsequent chapters focus on plants, primates, carnivores and plant-eaters, birds, fruit bats and gliding animals, and insects, with an emphasis on the ecological and biogeographical differences between regions. This is followed by a new chapter on the unique tropical rain forests of oceanic islands. The final chapter, which has been completely rewritten, deals with the impacts of people on tropical rain forests and discusses possible conservation strategies that take into account the differences highlighted in the previous chapters. This exciting and very readable book, illustrated throughout with color photographs, will be invaluable reading for undergraduate students in a wide range of courses as well as an authoritative reference for graduate and professional ecologists, conservationists, and interested amateurs.},

  abstract = {Tropical rain forests (TRF) are the most diverse terrestrial biome on Earth, but the diversification dynamics of their constituent growth forms remain largely unexplored. Climbing plants contribute significantly to species diversity and ecosystem processes in TRF. We investigate the broad-scale patterns and drivers of species richness as well as the diversification history of climbing and non-climbing palms (Arecaceae). We quantify to what extent macroecological diversity patterns are related to contemporary climate, forest canopy height and paleoclimatic changes. We test whether diversification rates are higher for climbing than non-climbing palms and estimate the origin of the climbing habit. Climbers account for 22\% of global palm species diversity mostly concentrated in Southeast Asia. Global variation in climbing palm species richness can be partly explained by past and present-day climate and rain forest canopy height, but regional differences in residual species richness after accounting for current and past differences in environment suggest a strong role of historical contingencies in climbing palm diversification. Climbing palms show a higher net diversification rate than non-climbers. Diversification analysis of palms detected a diversification rate increase along the branches leading to the most species-rich clade of climbers. Ancestral character reconstructions revealed that the climbing habit originated between early Eocene and Miocene. These results imply that changes from non-climbing to climbing habit may have played an important role in palm diversification, resulting in the origin of one fifth of all palm species. We suggest that, in addition to current climate and paleoclimatic changes after the late Neogene, present-day diversity of climbing palms can be explained by morpho-anatomical innovations, the biogeographic history of Southeast Asia, and/or ecological opportunities due to the diversification of high-stature dipterocarps in Asian TRFs.},

  abstract = {Historical biogeography is going through an extraordinary revolution concerning its foundations, basic concepts, methods, and relationships to other disciplines of comparative biology. There are external and internal forces that are shaping the present of historical biogeography. The external forces are: global tectonics as the dominant paradigm in geosciences, cladistics as the basic language of comparative biology and the biologist's perception of biogeography. The internal forces are: the proliferation of competing articulations, recourse to philosophy and the debate over fundamentals. The importance of the geographical dimension of life's diversity to any understanding of the history of life on earth is emphasized. Three different kinds of processes that modify the geographical spatial arrangement of the organisms are identified: extinction, dispersal and vicariance. Reconstructing past biogeographic events can be done from three different perspectives: (1) the distribution of individual groups (taxon biogeography) (2) areas of endemism (area biogeography), and (3) biotas (spatial homology). There are at least nine basic historical biogeographic approaches: centre of origin and dispersal, panbiogeography, phylogenetic biogeography, cladistic biogeography, phylogeography, parsimony analysis of endemicity, event-based methods, ancestral areas, and experimental biogeography. These nine approaches contain at least 30 techniques (23 of them have been proposed in the last 14 years). The whole practice and philosophy of biogeography depend upon the development of a coherent and comprehensive conceptual framework for handling the distribution of organisms and events in space.},

  abstract = {How biodiversity is generated and maintained underlies many major questions in evolutionary biology, particularly relating to the tempo and pattern of diversification through time. Molecular phylogenies and new analytical methods provide additional tools to help interpret evolutionary processes. Evolutionary rates in lineages sometimes appear punctuated, and such ``explosive'' radiations are commonly interpreted as adaptive, leading to causative key innovations being sought. Here we argue that an alternative process might explain apparently rapid radiations (``broom-and-handle'' or ``stemmy'' patterns seen in many phylogenies) with no need to invoke dramatic increase in the rate of diversification. We use simulations to show that mass extinction events can produce the same phylogenetic pattern as that currently being interpreted as due to an adaptive radiation. By comparing simulated and empirical phylogenies of Australian and southern African legumes, we find evidence for coincident mass extinctions in multiple lineages that could have resulted from global climate change at the end of the Eocene.},

We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships in Cryptanthus based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) including 48 species and 109 accessions. The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis revealed four major lineages in Cryptanthus and provided further evidence for the paraphyly of subgen. Hoplocryptanthus, while subgenus Cryptanthus was resolved as monophyletic. Monophyly of previously recognized morphological species groups at sectional level could not be confirmed. Based on the phylogenetic reconstruction we inferred the evolution of the sex system in Cryptanthus via maximum likelihood (ML) ancestral character reconstruction. Homoecy, the possession of hermaphrodite flowers only, was reconstructed as the ancestral state in the genus and characterizes three of the four main lineages within Cryptanthus. Andromonoecy, the possession of male and hermaphrodite flowers on the same plant, evolved only once and represents a synapomorphy of the fourth main lineage, C. subgen. Cryptanthus. The ancestral biome analysis reconstructed Cerrado (semiarid scrublands and forests) and campos rupestres (rock fields) as the most likely ancestral biomes for the genus. A shift to the Atlantic Forest biome was reconstructed to have occurred twice, in the ancestor of the first diverging lineage within the genus and in the ancestor of the C. subgen. Cryptanthus clade. A shift to the Caatinga (tropical dryland savanna) and one reversal to Cerrado (campos rupestres - rock fields) was reconstructed to have occurred once, in C. bahianus and C. arelii, respectively. The ancestral biome reconstruction indicates a high degree of niche conservatism within Cryptanthus with rare biome shifts throughout the evolution of the genus. Further, our results imply that the current infrageneric taxonomy of Cryptanthus is problematic and requires revision.},

  abstract = {Biome conservatism is often regarded as common in diversifying lineages, based on the detection of low biome shift rates or high phylogenetic signal. However, many studies testing biome conservatism utilise a single-biome-per-species approach, which may influence the detection of biome conservatism. Meta-analyses show that biome shift rates are significantly lower (less than a tenth), when single biome occupancy approaches are adopted. Using New Zealand plant lineages, estimated biome shifts were also significantly lower (14\textendash 67\% fewer biome shifts) when analysed under the assumption of a single biome per species. Although a single biome approach consistently resulted in lower biome shifts, it detected fewer instances of biome conservatism. A third of clades (3 out of 9) changed status in biome conservatism tests between single and multiple biome occupancy approaches, with more instances of significant biome conservatism when using a multiple biome occupancy approach. A single biome approach may change the likelihood of finding biome conservatism because it assumes biome specialisation within species, falsely recognises some biome shift types and fails to include other biome shift types. Our results indicate that the degree of biome fidelity assumed has a strong influence on analyses assessing biome shift rates, and biome conservatism testing. We advocate analyses that allow species to occupy multiple biomes.},

Subsequent inferred intercontinental divergence events involving xerophytic ancestors are consistent with the Madrean-Tethyan hypothesis, which postulates an early Tertiary floristic link between the and regions of western North America and western Eurasia. Calibration of branch lengths with the fossil record suggests that the North American and western Eurasian lineages diverged between 6 and 32 million years ago. The oldest of these values is consistent with both the Madrean-Tethyan hypothesis ({$>$}23 million years ago) and dispersion across a North Atlantic land bridge connecting Europe to North America ({$>$}13 million years ago), whereas the youngest requires an explanation involving long-distance dispersal.},

To orient this line of research we develop a conceptual framework in which the likelihood of a biome shift is a function of (a) exposure to contrasting environments over time, (b) the evolutionary accessibility of relevant adaptations, and (c) changing biotic interactions. We evaluate the literature on biome shifts in plants in relation to a set of hypotheses on the size, connectedness, and absolute age of biomes, as well as on the adaptability of particular lineages and ecological interactions over time. We also critique the phylogenetic inference of past biomes and a "global" model-based approach to biome evolution. More robust generalizations about biome shifts will require detailed studies of well-sampled and well-resolved clades, accounting for changes in the relevant abiotic and biotic factors through time.},

Within the two Atlantic-track taxa considered here-Liquidambar and Cercis-European and North American species are more closely related to one another than they are to the Asian species. Within a set of five Pacific-track taxa-Hamamelis, Weigela-Diervilla, Triosteum, Buckleya, and Torreya-we see all possible relationships involving China, Japan, and eastern North America. Estimates of minimum divergence times between Old World and New World lineages, based on molecular and fossil evidence, differ markedly between the two Atlantic-track clades. Among the Pacific-track taxa, we find no correlation between pattern of area relationships and estimated divergence times of the Old World-New World disjuncts. Instead, we see a wide range in the timing of these splitting events among and within phylogenetic patterns. Despite the existence of a variety of patterns, inferred ancestral areas and divergence times can be explained by assuming initial diversification within Asia in a number of lineages, followed by iterative trans-Beringian dispersion and vicariance.},

  abstract = {The concept of the biome has a long history dating back to Carl Ludwig Willdenow and Alexander von Humboldt. However, while the association between climate and the structure and diversity of vegetation has a long history, scientists have only recently begun to develop a more synthetic understanding of biomes based on the evolution of plant diversity, function, and community assembly. At the broadest scales, climate filters species based on their functional attributes, and the resulting functional differences in dominant vegetation among biomes are important to modeling the global carbon cycle and the functioning of the Earth system. Nevertheless, across biomes, plant species have been shown to occupy a common set of global functional `spectra,' reflecting variation in overall plant size, leaf economics, and hydraulics. Still, comprehensive measures of functional diversity and assessments of functional similarity have not been compared across biomes at continental to global scales. Here, we examine distributions of functional diversity of plant species across the biomes of North and South America, based on distributional information for {$>$}80,000 vascular plant species and functional trait data for ca. 8,000 of those species. First, we show that despite progress in data integration and synthesis, significant knowledge shortfalls persist that limit our ability to quantify the functional biodiversity of biomes. Second, our analyses of the available data show that all the biomes in North and South America share a common pattern - most geographically common, widespread species in any biome tend to be functionally similar while the most functionally distinctive species are restricted in their distribution. Third, when only the widespread and functionally similar species in each biome are considered, biomes can be more readily distinguished functionally, and patterns of dissimilarity between biomes appear to reflect a correspondence between climate and functional niche space. Taken together, our results suggest that while the study of the functional diversity of biomes is still in its formative stages, further development of the field will yield insights linking evolution, biogeography, community assembly, and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Grasslands cover more than 20\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, and their rise to dominance is one of the most dramatic events of biome evolution in Earth history. Grasses possess two main photosynthetic pathways: the C3 pathway that is typical of most plants and a specialized C4 pathway that minimizes photorespiration and thus increases photosynthetic performance in high-temperature and/or low-CO2 environments. C4 grasses dominate tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas, and C3 grasses dominate the world's cooler temperate grassland regions. This striking pattern has been attributed to C4 physiology, with the implication that the evolution of the pathway enabled C4 grasses to persist in warmer climates than their C3 relatives. We combined geospatial and molecular sequence data from two public archives to produce a 1,230-taxon phylogeny of the grasses with accompanying climate data for all species, extracted from more than 1.1 million herbarium specimens. Here we show that grasses are ancestrally a warm-adapted clade and that C4 evolution was not correlated with shifts between temperate and tropical biomes. Instead, 18 of 20 inferred C4 origins were correlated with marked reductions in mean annual precipitation. These changes are consistent with a shift out of tropical forest environments and into tropical woodland/savanna systems. We conclude that C4 evolution in grasses coincided largely with migration out of the understory and into open-canopy environments. Furthermore, we argue that the evolution of cold tolerance in certain C3 lineages is an overlooked innovation that has profoundly influenced the patterning of grassland communities across the globe.},

As phylogeography moves into the era of next-generation sequencing, the specter of reticulation at several levels-within loci and genomes in the form of recombination and across populations and species in the form of introgression-has raised its head with a prominence even greater than glimpsed during the nuclear gene PCR era. Here we explore the theme of reticulation in comparative phylogeography, speciation analysis, and phylogenomics, and ask how the centrality of gene trees has fared in the next-generation era. To frame these issues, we first provide a snapshot of multilocus phylogeographic studies across the Carpentarian Barrier, a prominent biogeographic barrier dividing faunas spanning the monsoon tropics in northern Australia. We find that divergence across this barrier is evident in most species, but is heterogeneous in time and demographic history, often reflecting the taxonomic distinctness of lineages spanning it. We then discuss a variety of forces generating reticulate patterns in phylogeography, including introgression, contact zones, and the potential selection-driven outliers on next-generation molecular markers. We emphasize the continued need for demographic models incorporating reticulation at the level of genomes and populations, and conclude that gene trees, whether explicit or implicit, should continue to play a role in the future of phylogeography.},

Conclusions 1419 Acknowledgements 1419 References 1419 Summary Tropical rainforest (TRF) is the most species-rich terrestrial biome on Earth, harbouring just under half of the world's plant species in c. 7\% of the land surface. Phylogenetic trees provide important insights into mechanisms underpinning TRF hyperdiversity that are complementary to those obtained from the fossil record. Phylogenetic studies of TRF plant diversity have mainly focused on whether this biome is an evolutionary `cradle' or `museum', emphasizing speciation and extinction rates. However, other explanations, such as biome age, immigration and ecological limits, must also be considered. We present a conceptual framework for addressing the drivers of TRF diversity, and review plant studies that have tested them with phylogenetic data. Although surprisingly few in number, these studies point to old age of TRF, low extinction and high speciation rates as credible drivers of TRF hyperdiversity. There is less evidence for immigration and ecological limits, but these cannot be dismissed owing to the limited number of studies. Rapid methodological developments in DNA sequencing, macroevolutionary analysis and the integration of phylogenetics with other disciplines may improve our grasp of TRF hyperdiversity in the future. However, such advances are critically dependent on fundamental systematic research, yielding numerous, additional, well-sampled phylogenies of TRF lineages.},

By contrast, the Detarioideae is much more diverse in Africa than in South America and Asia. To better understand the evolution of this contrasting diversity pattern, we investigated the biogeographical and ecological origin of this subfamily, testing whether they originated in dry biomes surrounding the Tethys Seaway as currently hypothesized for many groups of Leguminosae. We constructed the largest time-calibrated phylogeny for the subfamily to date, reconstructed ancestral states for geography and biome/habitat, estimated diversification and extinction rates, and evaluated biome/habitat and geographic shifts in Detarioideae. The ancestral habitat of Detarioideae is postulated to be a primary forest (terra firme) originated in Africa\textendash South America, in the early Palaeocene, after which several biome/habitat and geographic shifts occurred. The origin of Detarioideae is older than previous estimates, which postulated a dry (succulent) biome origin according to the Tethys Seaway hypothesis, and instead we reveal a post Gondwana and terra firme origin for this early branching clade of legumes. Detarioideae include some of the most dominant trees in evergreen forests and have likely played a pivotal role in shaping continental African forest diversity.},

We evaluate liana floristics, diversity, and structure in the Ituri Forest, and determine the effects of forest structure and edaphic variation on liana species composition. Methods \textendash{} Two permanent 10-ha plots (200 \texttimes{} 500 m), 500 m apart, were established in mixed forest. All liana individuals {$\geq$} 2 cm dbh were identified, measured, mapped, and marked. For 20 \texttimes{} 20 m subplots we distinguished terra firme and swamp, and we estimated canopy openness. Key results \textendash{} The combined 20-ha area contains 15,008 lianas (dbh {$\geq$} 2 cm) representing 195 species, 83 genera, and 34 families. Per hectare, species number averaged 64, mean basal area was 0.71 m2 and mean Fisher's alpha, Shannon index, and Simpson diversity index values were 17.9, 3.1 and 11.4, respectively. Ten dominant plant families represented 69\% of total species richness, 92\% of liana abundance and 92\% of basal area, while ten dominant species accounted for 63\% of abundance and 59\% of basal area. A single species, Manniophyton fulvum, dominated the liana community (22\% of all individuals). Forty-one species (21\%) had one individual only. Twiners, zoochorous, light-demanding, and meso- or microphyllous species dominated. Liana abundance increased with abundance of medium-sized and large trees but was, surprisingly, independent of small-tree abundance. Canopy openness, habitat type, and tree size were the most important factors influencing abundance and distribution of liana individuals. Conclusions \textendash{} The Ituri liana assemblage stands out by showing an extreme one-species dominance. Species floristic composition is, however, generally similar to that in other tropical African forests.},

  abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The North American Cercis Glade spans dry to mesic climates and exhibits complex morphological variation. We tested various proposed species classifications of this group and whether aspects of leaf morphology, particularly the "drip-tip" in some regional populations, are adaptive and/or linked with phylogeny. METHODS: We made measurements on over 1100 herbarium specimens from throughout North America and analyzed the data with univariate and multivariate approaches. We analyzed phylogenetically DNA sequence data from nuclear ITS and three plastid regions from 40 samples, and estimated divergence times with a relaxed-clock Bayesian analysis. We used climate and geographic position data to predict the variation observed in leaf size and shape by using stepwise multiple linear regressions. KEY RESULTS: Morphometric analyses yielded a pattern of continuous and often clinal character variation across North America, without correlated gaps in character states. Conversely, phylogenetic and divergence time analyses yielded distinct clades from California, the interior west, and eastern North America separated by between similar to 12 and 16 million years. Multiple regressions yielded highly significant correlations between leaf apex shape and precipitation of the warmest quarter. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a pattern of continuous morphological character variation, the long period of geographic and presumably genetic isolation warrants the delimitation of three species. Predictive modeling supports the adaptive value of acuminate apices or"drip-tips" in mesic habitats.This suggests that Cercis leaves change more rapidly than inferred from parsimony reconstruction, which has implications for the evolution of the dry floras of North America and Eurasia.},

  abstract = {The disjunct genus Cercis has been used to test models of Northern Hemisphere historical biogeography. Previous phylogenetic estimates employing DNA sequences of the ITS region and (in one study) those of ndhF recovered a well supported clade of North American and western Eurasian species that was nested within a paraphyletic group of Chinese species. Resolution and clade support within the tree were otherwise low and the monophyly of Cercis canadensis was uncertain. Here we conduct a phylogenetic analysis of Cercis with a higher number of regions (ITS, ndhF, rpoB-trnC, trnT-trnD, and trnS-trnG) and samples than in previous studies. Results corroborate the initial divergence between the Chinese species Cercis chingii and the rest of the genus. Support is newly found both for a clade of the two North American species as sister to the western Eurasian species, and for the monophyly of C. canadensis. As in a previous study, divergence between North American and western Eurasian Cercis was estimated as mid-Miocene (ca. 13 million years ago), and the ancestor in which this divergence occurred was inferred to be xerophytic. Contrary to previous studies, however, our data infer strictly east-to-west vicariance. The timing of the transatlantic divergence in Cercis is too recent to be explained by a postulated continuous belt of semi-arid vegetation between North America and Europe in the Paleogene, suggesting instead the presence of a Miocene North Atlantic corridor for semi-arid plants. In the absence of strong evidence from other sources, the possibility that Cercis has been able to quickly adapt from mesophytic antecedents to semi-arid conditions whenever the latter have arisen in the Northern Hemisphere can be considered a plausible alternative, although parsimony optimization renders this scenario two steps longer.

To address this question, we investigated the biogeography and trajectories of biome and growth form evolution across the Caesalpinia Group (Leguminosae), a clade of 225 species of trees, shrubs and lianas distributed across the Rainforest, Succulent, Temperate and Savanna Biomes. We focused especially on the little-known Succulent Biome, an assemblage of succulent-rich, grass-poor, seasonally dry tropical vegetation distributed disjunctly across the Neotropics, Africa, Arabia and Madagascar. We reconstructed a time-calibrated phylogeny, assembled species occurrence data and assigned species to areas, biomes and growth forms. These data are used to estimate the frequency of transcontinental disjunctions, biome shifts and evolutionary transitions between growth forms and test for phylogenetic biome conservatism and correlated evolution of growth forms and biome shifts. We uncovered a pattern of strong phylogenetic Succulent Biome conservatism. We showed that transcontinental disjunctions confined within the Succulent Biome are frequent and that biome shifts to the Savanna, Rainforest and Temperate Biomes are infrequent and closely associated with shifts in plant growth forms. Our results suggest that the Succulent Biome comprises an ecologically constrained evolutionary arena spanning large geographical disjunctions across the tropics.},

Such 19th century luminaries as Charles Darwin (1867) were fascinated by the peculiarities of climbing plants. However, despite their obvious importance in the world's flora, especially in tropical forests, climbers have subsequently been generally neglected. As summarized by Jacobs (1976), `The ecology of lianas is virtually a blank'. Indeed the significant ecological role played by lianas in tropical forests has only very recently begun to be investigated (e.g. Putz, 1984, 1985; Putz \&amp; Chai, 1987). Lianas have been no less neglected by plant collectors: quite probably lianas are the most undercollected of any major habit group of plants.This overview of climbing plants is based largely on 0.1 ha data sets for plants \&gt;2.5 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh). The sampling protocol under which these data were gathered was originally set up specifically to facilitate ecological sampling of lianas, which are notorious for clumped distributions related to rampant vegetative reproduction (Pe\~nalosa, 1984; Putz, 1984; Gentry, 1985). Each sample consists of ten 2 \texttimes{} 50 m narrowly rectangular plots set up end to end or separated by c. (10-)20 m, thus covering a relatively large area of forest that exceeds in scale the frequent `patches' of single liana species that presumably derive from vegetative reproduction.},

  abstract = {Climbing plants require an external support to grow vertically and enhance light acquisition. Vines that find a suitable support have greater performance and fitness than those that remain prostrate. Therefore, the location of a suitable support is a key process in the life history of climbing plants. Numerous studies on climbing plant behaviour have elucidated mechanistic details of support searching and attachment. Far fewer studies have addressed the ecological significance of support-finding behaviour and the factors that affect it. Without this knowledge, little progress can be made in the understanding of the evolution of support-finding behaviour in climbers. Here I review studies addressing ecological causes and consequences of support finding and use by climbing plants. I also propose the use of behavioural ecology theoretical frameworks to study climbing plant behaviour. I show how host tree attributes may determine the probability of successful colonization for the different types of climbers, and examine the evidence of environmental and genetic control of circumnutation behaviour and phenotypic responses to support availability. Cases of oriented vine growth towards supports are highlighted. I discuss functional responses of vines to the interplay between herbivory and support availability under different abiotic environments, illustrating with one study case how results comply with a theoretical framework of behavioural ecology originally conceived for animals. I conclude stressing that climbing plants are suitable study subjects for the application of behavioural\textendash ecological theory. Further research under this framework should aim at characterizing the different stages of the support-finding process in terms of their fit with the different climbing modes and environmental settings. In particular, cost\textendash benefit analysis of climbing plant behaviour should be helpful to infer the selective pressures that have operated to shape current climber ecological communities.},

A literature survey identified 48 pairs of sister groups from 45 families of flowering plants for which information on phylogenetic relationships, growth habit and species richness was available. In 38 cases, the climbing taxa were more diverse than their non-climbing sister groups. This pattern was highly significant. The same result was found when separate analyses were carried out for herbaceous and woody climbing plants, which differ in their constraints for successfully reaching a support.},

Yet existing biome classification schemes have been criticized for being overly subjective and for explicitly or implicitly invoking climate. We propose a new biome map and classification scheme that uses information on (i) an index of vegetation productivity, (ii) whether the minimum of vegetation activity is in the driest or coldest part of the year, and (iii) vegetation height. Although biomes produced on the basis of this classification show a strong spatial coherence, they show little congruence with existing biome classification schemes. Our biome map provides an alternative classification scheme for comparing the biogeochemical rates of terrestrial ecosystems. We use this new biome classification scheme to analyse the patterns of biome change observed over recent decades. Overall, 13\% to 14\% of analysed pixels shifted in biome state over the 30-year study period. A wide range of biome transitions were observed. For example, biomes with tall vegetation and minimum vegetation activity in the cold season shifted to higher productivity biome states. Biomes with short vegetation and low seasonality shifted to seasonally moisture-limited biome states. Our findings and method provide a new source of data for rigorously monitoring global vegetation change, analysing drivers of vegetation change and for benchmarking models of terrestrial ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {This paper and this issue attempt to address how, when and why the phenomenal c. 100,000 species of seed plants in tropical America (the Neotropics) arose. It is increasingly clear that an approach focusing on individual major biomes rather than a single aggregate view is useful because of evidence for differing diversification histories among biomes. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that Neotropical-scale diversification patterns are structured more ecologically than geographically, with a key role for phylogenetic niche or biome conservatism. Lower geographical structure reflects the fact that long-distance dispersal, inferred from dated phylogenetic trees, has overcome many supposed dispersal barriers. Overall, high rates of species turnover as inferred from palaeontological and molecular data have been the hallmark of plant evolutionary dynamics in the Neotropics throughout the Cenozoic, with most extant species diversity post-dating the Mid- to Late Miocene, perhaps reflecting the conjunction of both global climatic changes and geological upheavals such as the Neogene uplift of the tropical Andes. Future studies of Neotropical diversification will be facilitated by taxonomically and genetically better sampled phylogenetic analyses, their integration with palaeontological, geological and ecological data, and improved methods to estimate biogeographic history and diversification dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales. Future biome-focused approaches would benefit greatly from better delimitation and mapping of Neotropical biomes. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Linnean Society of London},

Tropical Africa is noteworthy for its shortage of Eocene fossils, which could serve as proxies for climate and reveal community structural evolution during the continent's geographic isolation. In this paper, we report paleobotanical remains from a middle Eocene crater lake at 12\textdegree S paleolatitude in north central Tanzania, which provide a plant community reconstruction indicating wooded, rather than forest, vegetation and precipitation estimates near modern (660 mm/year). The plant community was dominated by caesalpinioid legumes and was physiognomically comparable to modern miombo woodland. Paleoprecipitation estimates, the first for the Paleogene of Africa, are calculated from fossil leaf morphology using regression equations derived from modern low-latitude leaves and climate. Mean annual precipitation estimates are 643{$\pm$}32 and 776{$\pm$}39 mm/year, and wet months precipitation estimates (all months averaging{$\geq$}50 mm) are 630{$\pm$}38 and 661{$\pm$}38 mm. A slightly larger proportion of annual precipitation occurred in the dry months compared with today, which may indicate greater equability of precipitation in the Eocene.},

However, the significance of environmental factors in driving functional gradients within biomes and across continents remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the relationship of soil nutrients and climate to leaf traits in grasses (Poaceae) that are hypothesized to reflect different strategies of resource use along gradients of resource availability. Location Global. Taxon Poaceae. Methods We made direct measurements on herbarium specimens to compile a global dataset of functional traits and realized environmental niche for 279 grass species that are common in grassland and savanna biomes. We examined the strength and direction of correlations between pairwise trait combinations and measured the distribution of traits in relation to gradients of soil properties and climate, while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. Results Leaf trait variation among species follows two orthogonal axes. One axis represents leaf size and plant height, and we showed positive scaling relationships between these size-related traits. The other axis corresponds to economic traits associated with resource acquisition and allocation, including leaf tensile strength (LTS), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC). Global-scale variation in LNC was primarily correlated with soil nutrients, while LTS, SLA and size-related traits showed weak relationships to environment. However, most of the trait variation occurred within different vegetation types, independent of large-scale environmental gradients. Main conclusions Our work provides evidence among grasses for relationships at the global scale between leaf economic traits and soil fertility, and for an influence of aridity on traits related to plant size. However, large unexplained variance and strong phylogenetic signal in the model residuals imply that at this scale the evolution of functional traits is driven by factors beyond contemporary environmental or climatic conditions.},

The fossil record of Cercis L. needs to be understood in better detail as a basis for reconstructing the evolution for understanding the radiation of Caesalpinoideae. The genus can now be traced back to the late Eocene of western North America on the basis of fossil fruits and foliage from Oregon and Colorado. Pivotal results. We present a new occurrence of Cercis leaf fossils from Teater Road, Oregon ({$\sim$}36 Ma), that conforms to the species Cercis parvifolia Lesquereux, previously recognized from Florissant, Colorado ({$\sim$}34 Ma). Associated pods of Cercis herbmeyeri sp. n. represent the earliest confirmed fossil fruits of Cercis. In their indehiscent pods with a winglike flange along one margin, the fossils correspond to the main clade of Cercis rather than to the phylogenetically distinct extant species Cercis chingii. A review of other occurrences that we accept from the literature reveals that the genus was widespread in the Northern Hemisphere by the Miocene, although some earlier paleobotanical reports must be rejected. Conclusions. The fossil record indicates that Cercis was established by the late Eocene and had become widespread in the Northern Hemisphere by the Miocene. The late Eocene records have a lamina shape consistent with a mesic habitat but relatively small leaf size, which might indicate adaptation for drying conditions.},

The mimosoid legumes are a prominent pantropical clade of \textasciitilde 3300 species of woody angiosperms for which previous phylogenies have shown extensive lack of resolution, especially among the species-rich and taxonomically challenging ingoids. METHODS: We generated transcriptomes to select low-copy nuclear genes, enrich these via hybrid capture for representative species of most mimosoid genera, and analyze the resulting data using de novo assembly and various phylogenomic tools for species tree inference. We also evaluate gene tree support and conflict for key internodes and use phylogenetic network analysis to investigate phylogenetic signal across the ingoids. RESULTS: Our selection of 964 nuclear genes greatly improves phylogenetic resolution across the mimosoid phylogeny and shows that the ingoid clade can be resolved into several well-supported clades. However, nearly all loci show lack of phylogenetic signal for some of the deeper internodes within the ingoids. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of resolution in the ingoid clade is most likely the result of hyperfast diversification, potentially causing a hard polytomy of six or seven lineages. The gene set for targeted sequencing presented here offers great potential to further enhance the phylogeny of mimosoids and the wider Caesalpinioideae with denser taxon sampling, to provide a framework for taxonomic reclassification, and to study the ingoid radiation.},

We investigate the deep-branching relationships among subfamilies of the Leguminosae (or Fabaceae), the third largest angiosperm family. Despite their ecological and economic importance, a robust phylogenetic framework for legumes based on genome-scale sequence data is lacking. We generated alignments of 72 chloroplast genes and 7621 homologous nuclear-encoded proteins, for 157 and 76 taxa, respectively. We analysed these with maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and a multispecies coalescent summary method, and evaluated support for alternative topologies across gene trees. We resolve the deepest divergences in the legume phylogeny despite lack of phylogenetic signal across all chloroplast genes and the majority of nuclear genes. Strongly supported conflict in the remainder of nuclear genes is suggestive of incomplete lineage sorting. All six subfamilies originated nearly simultaneously, suggesting that the prevailing view of some subfamilies as `basal' or `early-diverging' with respect to others should be abandoned, which has important implications for understanding the evolution of legume diversity and traits.

The apparent concentration of whole genome duplication (WGD) events around the KPB may have played a role in survival and subsequent diversification of plant lineages. To gain new insights into the origins of Cenozoic biodiversity, we examine the origin and early evolution of the globally diverse legume family (Leguminosae or Fabaceae). Legumes are ecologically (co-)dominant across many vegetation types, and the fossil record suggests that they rose to such prominence after the KPB in parallel with several well-studied animal clades including Placentalia and Neoaves. Furthermore, multiple WGD events are hypothesized to have occurred early in legume evolution. Using a recently inferred phylogenomic framework, we investigate the placement of WGDs during early legume evolution using gene tree reconciliation methods, gene count data and phylogenetic supernetwork reconstruction. Using 20 fossil calibrations we estimate a revised timeline of legume evolution based on 36 nuclear genes selected as informative and evolving in an approximately clock-like fashion. To establish the timing of WGDs we also date duplication nodes in gene trees. Results suggest either a pan-legume WGD event on the stem lineage of the family, or an allopolyploid event involving (some of) the earliest lineages within the crown group, with additional nested WGDs subtending subfamilies Papilionoideae and Detarioideae. Gene tree reconciliation methods that do not account for allopolyploidy may be misleading in inferring an earlier WGD event at the time of divergence of the two parental lineages of the polyploid, suggesting that the allopolyploid scenario is more likely. We show that the crown age of the legumes dates to the Maastrichtian or early Paleocene and that, apart from the Detarioideae WGD, paleopolyploidy occurred close to the KPB. We conclude that the early evolution of the legumes followed a complex history, in which multiple auto- and/or allopolyploidy events coincided with rapid diversification and in association with the mass extinction event at the KPB, ultimately underpinning the evolutionary success of the Leguminosae in the Cenozoic.},

The mahoganies (Meliaceae) are a prominent plant group in lowland tropical rainforests world-wide but also occur in all other tropical ecosystems. We investigated whether rainforest diversity in Meliaceae has accumulated over a long time or has more recently evolved. We inferred the largest time-calibrated phylogeny for the family to date, reconstructed ancestral states for habitat and deciduousness, estimated diversification rates and modeled potential shifts in macro-evolutionary processes using a recently developed Bayesian method. The ancestral Meliaceae is reconstructed as a deciduous species that inhabited seasonal habitats. Rainforest clades have diversified from the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene onwards. Two contemporaneous Amazonian clades have converged on similar ecologies and high speciation rates. Most species-level diversity of Meliaceae in rainforest is recent. Other studies have found steady accumulation of lineages, but the large majority of plant species diversity in rainforests is recent, suggesting (episodic) species turnover. Rainforest hyperdiversity may best be explained by recent radiations from a large stock of higher level taxa.},

The main constraint of these methods is the computational limit on the number of areas that can be specified. We propose a Bayesian approach for inferring biogeographic history that extends the application of biogeographic models to the analysis of more realistic problems that involve a large number of areas. Our solution is based on a "data-augmentation" approach, in which we first populate the tree with a history of biogeographic events that is consistent with the observed species ranges at the tips of the tree. We then calculate the likelihood of a given history by adopting a mechanistic interpretation of the instantaneous-rate matrix, which specifies both the exponential waiting times between biogeographic events and the relative probabilities of each biogeographic change. We develop this approach in a Bayesian framework, marginalizing over all possible biogeographic histories using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Besides dramatically increasing the number of areas that can be accommodated in a biogeographic analysis, our method allows the parameters of a given biogeographic model to be estimated and different biogeographic models to be objectively compared. Our approach is implemented in the program, BayArea. [ancestral area analysis; Bayesian biogeographic inference; data augmentation; historical biogeography; Markov chain Monte Carlo.].},

We corroborate these results with a suite of climate model simulations demonstrating that only simulations including a decline in \$\$p\{\{\textbackslash rm\{CO\}\}\_\{2\}\}\$\$lead to a cooling in southeast Australia consistent with our proxy record. Our data form an important benchmark for testing climate model performance, sea\textendash land interaction and climatic forcings at the onset of a major Antarctic glaciation.},

Both of these young age estimates are detected despite methodological approaches that bias results toward older ages. Hypotheses that resort to vicariance or continental history to explain continental disjunct distributions are dismissed because they require mostly Palaeogene and older tectonic events. An alternative explanation centring on dispersal that may well explain the geographical as well as the ecological phylogenetic structure of legume phylogenies is Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography.

  abstract = {The classification of the legume family proposed here addresses the long-known non-monophyly of the traditionally recognised subfamily Caesalpinioideae, by recognising six robustly supported monophyletic subfamilies. This new classification uses as its framework the most comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of legumes to date, based on plastid matK gene sequences, and including near-complete sampling of genera (698 of the currently recognised 765 genera) and ca. 20\% (3696) of known species. The matK gene region has been the most widely sequenced across the legumes, and in most legume lineages, this gene region is sufficiently variable to yield well-supported clades. This analysis resolves the same major clades as in other phylogenies of whole plastid and nuclear gene sets (with much sparser taxon sampling). Our analysis improves upon previous studies that have used large phylogenies of the Leguminosae for addressing evolutionary questions, because it maximises generic sampling and provides a phylogenetic tree that is based on a fully curated set of sequences that are vouchered and taxonomically validated. The phylogenetic trees obtained and the underlying data are available to browse and download, facilitating subsequent analyses that require evolutionary trees. Here we propose a new community-endorsed classification of the family that reflects the phylogenetic structure that is consistently resolved and recognises six subfamilies in Leguminosae: a recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae DC., Cercidoideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), Detarioideae Burmeist., Dialioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), Duparquetioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), and Papilionoideae DC. The traditionally recognised subfamily Mimosoideae is a distinct clade nested within the recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae and is referred to informally as the mimosoid clade pending a forthcoming formal tribal and/or cladebased classification of the new Caesalpinioideae. We provide a key for subfamily identification, descriptions with diagnostic charactertistics for the subfamilies, figures illustrating their floral and fruit diversity, and lists of genera by subfamily. This new classification of Leguminosae represents a consensus view of the international legume systematics community; it invokes both compromise and practicality of use.}

  abstract = {Global change impacts on the Earth System are typically evaluated using biome classifications based on trees and forests. However, during the Cenozoic, many terrestrial biomes were transformed through the displacement of trees and shrubs by grasses. While grasses comprise 3\% of vascular plant species, they are responsible for more than 25\% of terrestrial photosynthesis. Critically, grass dominance alters ecosystem dynamics and function by introducing new ecological processes, especially surface fires and grazing. However, the large grassy component of many global biomes is often neglected in their descriptions, thereby ignoring these important ecosystem processes. Furthermore, the functional diversity of grasses in vegetation models is usually reduced to C3 and C4 photosynthetic plant functional types, omitting other relevant traits. Here, we compile available data to determine the global distribution of grassy vegetation and key traits related to grass dominance. Grassy biomes (where {$>$} 50\% of the ground layer is covered by grasses) occupy almost every part of Earth's vegetated climate space, characterising over 40\% of the land surface. Major evolutionary lineages of grasses have specialised in different environments, but species from only three grass lineages occupy 88\% of the land area of grassy vegetation, segregating along gradients of temperature, rainfall and fire. The environment occupied by each lineage is associated with unique plant trait combinations, including C3 and C4 photosynthesis, maximum plant height, and adaptations to fire and aridity. There is no single global climatic limit where C4 grasses replace C3 grasses. Instead this ecological transition varies biogeographically, with continental disjunctions arising through contrasting evolutionary histories. Significance statement Worldviews of vegetation generally focus on trees and forests but grasses characterize the ground layer over 40\% of the Earth's vegetated land surface. This omission is important because grasses transform surface-atmosphere exchanges, biodiversity and disturbance regimes. We looked beneath the trees to produce the first global map of grass-dominated biomes. Grassy biomes occur in virtually every climate on Earth. However, three lineages of grasses are much more successful than others, characterizing 88\% of the land area of grassy biomes. Each of these grass lineages evolved ecological specializations related to aridity, freezing and fire. Recognizing the extent and causes of grass dominance beneath trees is important because grassy vegetation plays vital roles in the dynamics of our biosphere and human wellbeing.},

The tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae), with 21 genera and c. 400 species, is the largest clade of lianas in the Neotropics. The group is an excellent model for biogeographical and evolutionary studies as it is widely distributed and exhibits high levels of morphological diversity. Here, we investigate the biogeographical history of Bignonieae using a tribe-wide time-calibrated phylogenetic tree as a basis for ancestral area reconstructions. We examine four hypotheses for the origin and subsequent biogeographical spread of the tribe. Our analyses suggest that the crown group of Bignonieae originated in South American rainforests approximately 50 Mya. Ancestral area reconstructions for the early divergences are equivocal, although the resulting Adenocalymma\textendash Neojobertia and core Bignonieae clades appear to have occurred in eastern South America and lowland Amazonia, respectively. Our analyses suggest that, following this initial split, most lineages of Bignonieae have been repeatedly exchanged between biogeographical areas. These events occurred over a broad time span and are likely to have had multiple drivers; climate drying and the Andean Orogeny may have been particularly important for shaping overall diversity. In Bignonieae, contemporary distribution patterns appear to have been strongly influenced by Holocene environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 171, 154\textendash 170.},

Despite being a conspicuous component of the neotropical flora, the systematics of the tribe has remained uncertain due to confusing patterns of morphological variation within the group. Chloroplast (ndhF) and nuclear (PepC) DNA sequences were used here to reconstruct the phylogeny of Bignonieae. Individual analyses of ndhF and PepC were highly similar to one another, yet localized differences in the placement of six species suggests some conflict between data sets. Combined analyses result in trees that are consistent with those from the individual analyses and provide greater support for the suggested relationships. This phylogeny provides important new insights into the systematics of the tribe. It identifies 21 strongly supported species groups, eight of which broadly correspond to currently recognized genera. In addition, each of these 21 species groups is supported by morphological synapomorphies. The consistency between morphological and molecular data suggests that the current phylogeny provides a solid framework for a formal revision of the generic-level classification and for addressing other aspects of the biology of Bignonieae.},

  abstract = {Tropical rainforest plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, accounting for a large part of global net primary productivity and contributing to CO2 sequestration. The objective of this work is to simulate potential changes in the rainforest biome in Central America subject to anthropogenic climate change under two emissions scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The use of a dynamic vegetation model and climate change scenarios is an approach to investigate, assess or anticipate how biomes respond to climate change. In this work, the Inland dynamic vegetation model was driven by the Eta regional climate model simulations. These simulations accept boundary conditions from HadGEM2-ES runs in the two emissions scenarios. The possible consequences of regional climate change on vegetation properties, such as biomass, net primary production and changes in forest extent and distribution, were investigated. The Inland model projections show reductions in tropical forest cover in both scenarios. The reduction of tropical forest cover is greater in RCP8.5. The Inland model projects biomass increases where tropical forest remains due to the CO2 fertilization effect. The future distribution of predominant vegetation shows that some areas of tropical rainforest in Central America are replaced by savannah and grassland in RCP4.5. Inland projections under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 show a net primary productivity reduction trend due to significant tropical forest reduction, temperature increase, precipitation reduction and dry spell increments, despite the biomass increases in some areas of Costa Rica and Panama. This study may provide guidance to adaptation studies of climate change impacts on the tropical rainforests in Central America.},

We consider three interpretations of random trees: first, that trees are selected from the set of all possible trees with equal probability; second, that trees are formed by random speciation or coalescence (equivalent); and third, that trees are formed by a series of random partitions of the taxa. We consider two interpretations of random characters: first, that the number of taxa with each state is held constant, but the states are randomly reshuffled among the taxa; and second, that the probability each taxon is assigned a particular state is constant from one taxon to the next. Under null models representing various combinations of randomizations of trees and characters, exact recursion equations are given to calculate the probability distribution of the number of character state changes required by a phylogenetic tree. Possible applications of these probability distributions are discussed. They can be used, for example, to test for a panmictic population structure within a species or to test phylogenetic inertia in a character's evolution. Whether and how a null model incorporates tree randomness makes little difference to the probability distribution in many but not all circumstances. The null model's sense of character randomness appears more critical. The difficult issue of choosing a null model is discussed.},

We tested biogeographic hypotheses regarding the timing of species disjunctions to eastern Asia and among areas of North America. \textbullet{} Methods: We delimited species into biogeographically informative clades, compiled sister-area data, and generated graphic representations of area connections across clades. We calculated taxon diversity within clades and plotted divergence times. \textbullet{} Key results: Of the total taxon diversity, 45\% were distributed among 25 North American endemic clades. Sister taxa within eastern North America and eastern Asia were proportionally equal in frequency, accounting for over 50\% of the sister-area connections. At increasing phylogenetic depth, connections to the Old World dominated. Divergence times for 65 clades with intercontinental disjunctions were continuous, whereas 11 intracontinental disjunctions to western North America and nine to eastern Mexico were temporally congruent. \textbullet{} Conclusions: Over one third of the clades have likely undergone speciation within the region of eastern North America. The biogeographic pattern for the region is asymmetric, consisting of mostly mixed-aged, low-diversity clades connecting to the Old World, and a minority of New World clades. Divergence time data suggest that climate change in the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene generated disjunct patterns within North America. Continuous splitting times during the last 45 million years support the hypothesis that widespread distributions formed repeatedly during favorable periods, with serial cooling trends producing pseudocongruent area disjunctions between eastern North America and eastern Asia.},

  abstract = {Biomes are globally distributed, structurally and functionally similar vegetation units defined without reference to plant species composition. The boundaries between biomes are presumed to correspond with species turnover and changes in biogeochemical cycling. Determining the controls of biome distributions is thus critical for anticipating global change impacts. Historically, climate and soils have been understood to adequately explain the global distribution of biomes. Convergent evolution and environmental filtering are assumed to be pervasive, ultimately resulting in deterministic patterns of vegetation structure and function in relation to prevailing environmental conditions. Recent studies have highlighted significant problems with this view of biomes. Firstly, systematic structural and functional divergence within biomes has been identified when comparing environmentally similar, yet floristically distinct regions. Secondly, climatic determinism is being further undermined by evidence suggesting multiple stable biome states are possible for some combinations of climatic drivers. We argue that biomes remain useful and necessary constructs for organizing our knowledge of how ecosystems function and for predicting how they might respond to change. However, biome concepts should acknowledge the limits to predictability from environmental conditions alone and the influence of historical processes on modern vegetation patterns. We discuss how direct mapping of plant structure and function, the incorporation of insights into biome evolution and a new generation of vegetation models will lead to improvements in the concept of what biomes are, where they occur, and efforts to predict their distribution.},

  abstract = {Aim The aim was to test whether species distribution models (SDMs) can reproduce major macroecological patterns in a species-rich, tropical region and provide recommendations for using SDMs in areas with sparse biotic inventory data. Location North-east Brazil, including Minas Gerais. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Flowering plants. Methods Species composition estimates derived from stacked SDMs (s-SDMs) were compared with data from 1,506 inventories of 933 woody plant species from north-east Brazil. Both datasets were used in hierarchical clustering analyses to delimit floristic units that correspond to biomes. The ability of s-SDMs to predict the identity, functional composition and floristic composition of biomes was compared across geographical and environmental space. Results The s-SDMs and inventory data both resolved four major biomes that largely corresponded in terms of their distribution, floristics and function. The s-SDMs proved excellent at identifying broad-scale biomes and their function, but misassigned many individual sites in complex savanna\textendash forest mosaics. Main conclusions Our results show that s-SDMs have a unique role to play in describing macroecological patterns in areas lacking inventory data and for poorly known taxa. s-SDMs accurately predict floristic and functional macroecological patterns but struggle in areas where non-climatic factors, such as fire or soil, play key roles in governing distributions.},

  abstract = {A biome is a key community ecological and biogeographical concept and, as such, has profited from the overall progress of community ecology, punctuated by two major innovations: shifting the focus from pure pattern description to understanding functionality, and changing the approach from observational to explanatory and, most importantly, from descriptive to predictive. The functional focus enabled development of mechanistic and function-focused predictive and retrodictive modelling; it also shaped the current understanding of the concept of a biome as a dynamic biological entity having many aspects, with deep roots in the evolutionary past, and which is undergoing change. The evolution of the biome concept was punctuated by three synthetic steps: the first synthesis formulated a solid body of theory explaining the ecological and biogeographical meaning of zonality and collated our knowledge on drivers of vegetation patterns at large spatial scales; the second translated this knowledge into effective mechanistic modelling tools, developing further the link between ecosystem functionality and biogeography; and the third (still in progress) is seeking common ground between large-scale ecological and biogeographic phenomena, using macroecology and macroevolutionary research tools.},

Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7\% and 47.1\% of the DNA alignments and 42.2\% and 100\% of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3\textendash 97.1\%. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.},

The factors underlying lineage-specific niche lability are still not well understood. We examined morphological and climate niche evolution in Montiaceae (Caryophyllales), an ecologically variable plant lineage distributed primarily along the mountain chains of the western Americas. Montiaceae inhabit a broader range of temperatures than their relatives, with an increase in the evolutionary rate of temperature niche diversification at the node subtending this clade. Within Montiaceae, life history is highly labile and significantly correlated with temperature, with perennials consistently occurring in cooler environments. This elevated evolutionary lability facilitated repeated shifts between habitats as new environments were created by post-Eocene orogenic events and aridification in the western Americas. The shifts between annual and perennial forms are elaborations of an underlying rosette body plan in most cases, and may involve simple alterations in biomass allocation. Montiaceae stand as another clear counterexample to phylogenetic niche conservatism, and demonstrate a mechanism by which pronounced ecological shifts may occur frequently and rapidly among closely related species.},

  abstract = {Phylogenies of legume taxa are ecologically structured along a tropical seasonality gradient, which suggests phylogenetic niche conservatism. This seasonality gradient spans Neotropical wet forests, savannas, and highly seasonal drought-prone woody vegetation known as the succulent biome. Ecological phylogenetic structure was investigated using a community phylogenetic approach. We further analyzed bioclimatic and other independent variables that potentially explained phylogenetic beta diversity among 466 floristic sites that spanned the savanna and succulent biomes in eastern South America. Explanatory variables were selected using variance inflation factors, information criteria, and the ability to explain both species and phylogenetic beta diversity. A model involving annual precipitation suggests that a threshold of {$<$}1200mm explains community phylogenetic structure along the savanna\textendash succulent biome transition. Variables involving temperatures or measures of seasonality were notably lacking from top-ranked models. The abundance and diversity of legumes across the tropical seasonality gradient suggest that a high nitrogen metabolism confers an advantage in one of two ways, both of which are related to rapid growth rates. Legumes adapted to the succulent biome may be responding to regular post-dry-season leaf-flush opportunities. Legumes adapted to the savanna biome may be responding to intermittent post-disturbance growing opportunities. A seasonal predominance of leaf flushing by woody plants implicates the role of ecological stability in the succulent biome because of the need to recover the cost of regenerating short-lived leaves. Ecological stability may be the fundamental cause of ecological phylogenetic structure across the tropical seasonality gradient and required for maintaining high levels of both leaf-flushing legume and succulent plant biodiversity.},

The C4 pathway increases the potential for high rates of photosynthesis, particularly at high irradiance, and raises water-use efficiency compared with the C3 type. It is therefore classically viewed as an adaptation to open, arid conditions. Here, we test this adaptive hypothesis using the comparative method, analysing habitat data for 117 genera of grasses, representing 15 C4 lineages. The evidence from our three complementary analyses is consistent with the hypothesis that evolutionary selection for C4 photosynthesis requires open environments, but we find an equal likelihood of C4 evolutionary origins in mesic, arid and saline habitats. However, once the pathway has arisen, evolutionary transitions into arid habitats occur at higher rates in C4 than C3 clades. Extant C4 genera therefore occupy a wider range of drier habitats than their C3 counterparts because the C4 pathway represents a pre-adaptation to arid conditions. Our analyses warn against evolutionary inferences based solely upon the high occurrence of extant C4 species in dry habitats, and provide a novel interpretation of this classic ecological association.},

  abstract = {This review suggests that the ecology and patchy global distribution of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) has distinctively structured the evolutionary history and biogeography of woody plant groups that are confined to it. SDTFs have few widespread woody plant species causing high {$\beta$}-diversity between separate areas of forests. These separate areas contain geologically old, monophyletic clades of endemic plant species that often have geographically structured intraspecific genetic variation. These patterns of diversity, endemism, and phylogeny indicate a stable, dispersal-limited SDTF system. SDTF species tend to belong to larger clades confined to this vegetation, exemplifying phylogenetic niche conservatism, and we argue that this is evidence that the SDTF is a metacommunity (biome) for woody plant clades. That phylogenetic, population genetic, biogeographic, and community ecological patterns differ in woody plants from tropical rain forests and savannas suggests a hypothesis that broad ecological s...},

  abstract = {It has been argued that historical biogeography, the study of how processes that occur over long periods of time influence the distribution of life forms, is in the midst of a scientific revolution. The aim of this paper is to analyze the evolution of historical biogeography during the first decade of the 21st century and to identify major trends for the near future. We constructed a database containing all articles which dealt with historical biogeography published in the Journal of Biogeography during 1998\textendash 2010. The database included 610 contributions. Our results indicated that historical biogeography is going through a growth period. The papers analyzed were written by 2018 authors, with a mean of 3.3 authors per paper. Authors from 62 countries were involved, and most of them worked in Europe or North America. The Palearctic was the most analyzed region. Most contributions dealt with terrestrial habitats and were devoted to animal (especially Chordata) and plant taxa. Phylogeography was the most used approach (35\%), followed by biota similarity and PAE (13\%) and molecular biogeography (12\%), with cladistic biogeography and event-based methods at 6\% each. Some of the future challenges that historical biogeography faces are summarized: (1) to increase the study of taxa which are underrepresented according to the segment of biodiversity they represent; (2) to balance the amount of work devoted to different biogeographical regions; (3) to increase biogeographical knowledge of aquatic habitats; (4) to maintain the diversity of approaches, preventing the reduction of time, spatial, and taxonomic scales addressed by the discipline; and (5) to continue integrating historical biogeography along with other sources of information from other disciplines (e.g. ecology, paleontology, geology, isotope chemistry, remote sensing) into a richer context for explaining past, present, and future patterns of biodiversity on Earth.},

This dataset is internally consistent and provides a comprehensive overview of vegetational change from 15.97 to 5.33Ma. The palaeobotanical dataset has been translated into the BIOME4 classification scheme to enable direct comparison with climate model outputs. The vegetation change throughout the Langhian, Seravallian, Tortonian and Messinian is discussed. The data shows that the Langhian, which includes the end of the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, represents a world significantly warmer than today. The high northern latitudes were characterised by cool-temperate forests, the mid-latitudes by warm-temperate mixed forests, the tropics by tropical evergreen broadleaf forests and Antarctica by tundra shrub vegetation. Cool-temperate mixed forest existed during the Seravallian in the high northern latitudes, a reduction in warm-temperate mixed forests in the mid latitudes and a loss of tundra on Antarctica was noted. Tortonian vegetation distribution indicates that further cooling had occurred since the Seravallian. The major changes in vegetation include the first evidence for cold taiga forest in the high northern latitudes and a further reduction of warm-temperate mixed forests. By the Messinian, this cooling trend had eliminated warm-temperate mixed forests from the western USA and Australia and had formed mid-latitude deserts. Despite the cooling trend throughout the Mid to Late Miocene, the vegetation distribution of all four reconstructed stages reflect the vegetation of a world warmer than the pre-industrial conditions. The latitudinal distribution of bioclimatic zones suggests that the latitudinal temperature gradient for the Langhian would have been significantly shallower than at present and has gradually, but asymmetrically, become more modern towards the end of the Miocene. First the southern hemisphere distribution of bioclimatic zones became more modern, probably due to the climatic effects of a fully glaciated Antarctica. The northern hemisphere bioclimatic zone gradient continued to be shallower than modern throughout the Miocene and slowly became more modern by the Messinian.},

A large and rapid drop in atmospheric pCO2 has been proposed as the driving force behind extinctions in the marine realm and glaciation on Antarctica. However, the global terrestrial response to this cooling is uncertain. Here we present the first global vegetation and terrestrial temperature reconstructions for the EOT. Using an extensive palynological dataset, that has been statistically grouped into palaeo-biomes, we show a more transitional nature of terrestrial climate change by indicating a spatial and temporal heterogeneity of vegetation change at the EOT in both hemispheres. The reconstructed terrestrial temperatures show for many regions a cooling that started well before the EOT and continued into the Early Oligocene. We conclude that the heterogeneous pattern of global vegetation change has been controlled by a combination of multiple forcings, such as tectonics, sea-level fall and long-term decline in greenhouse gas concentrations during the late Eocene to early Oligocene, and does not represent a single response to a rapid decline in atmospheric pCO2 at the EOT.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) typically refers to the tendency of closely related species to be more similar to each other in terms of niche than they are to more distant relatives. This has been implicated as a potential driving force in speciation and other species-richness patterns, such as latitudinal gradients. However, PNC has not been very well defined in most previous studies. Is it a pattern or a process? What are the underlying endogenous (e.g. genetic) and exogenous (e.g. ecological) factors that cause niches to be conserved? What degree of similarity is necessary to qualify as PNC? Is it possible for the evolutionary processes causing niches to be conserved to also result in niche divergence in different habitats? Here, we revisit these questions, codifying a theoretical and operational definition of PNC as a mechanistic evolutionary process resulting from several factors. We frame this both from a macroevolutionary and population-genetic perspective. We discuss how different axes of physical (e.g. geographic) and environmental (e.g. climatic) heterogeneity interact with the fundamental process of PNC to produce different outcomes of ecological speciation. We also review tests for PNC, and suggest ways that these could be improved or better utilized in future studies. Ultimately, PNC as a process has a well-defined mechanistic basis in organisms, and future studies investigating ecological speciation would be well served to consider this, and frame hypothesis testing in terms of the processes and expected patterns described herein. The process of PNC may lead to patterns where niches are conserved (more similar than expected), constrained (divergent within a limited subset of available niches), or divergent (less similar than expected), based on degree of phylogenetic relatedness between species.},

  abstract = {In historical biogeography, model-based inference methods for reconstructing the evolution of geographic ranges on phylogenetic trees are poorly developed relative to the diversity of analogous methods available for inferring character evolution. We attempt to rectify this deficiency by constructing a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model for geographic range evolution that specifies instantaneous transition rates between discrete states (ranges) along phylogenetic branches and apply it to estimating likelihoods of ancestral states (range inheritance scenarios) at cladogenesis events. Unlike an earlier version of this approach, the present model allows for an analytical solution to probabilities of range transitions as a function of time, enabling free parameters in the model, rates of dispersal, and local extinction to be estimated by maximum likelihood. Simulation results indicate that accurate parameter estimates may be difficult to obtain in practice but also show that ancestral range inheritance scenarios nevertheless can be correctly recovered with high success if rates of range evolution are low relative to the rate of cladogenesis. We apply the DEC model to a previously published, exemplary case study of island biogeography involving Hawaiian endemic angiosperms in Psychotria (Rubiaceae), showing how the DEC model can be iteratively refined from inspecting inferences of range evolution and also how geological constraints involving times of island origin may be imposed on the likelihood function. The DEC model is sufficiently similar to character models that it might serve as a gateway through which many existing comparative methods for characters could be imported into the realm of historical biogeography; moreover, it might also inspire the conceptual expansion of character models toward inclusion of evolutionary change as directly coincident, either as cause or consequence, with cladogenesis events. The DEC model is thus an incremental advance that highlights considerable potential in the nascent field of model-based historical biogeographic inference.},

We propose that combined assessment of evolutionary convergence of plant functional traits and phylogenetic biome conservatism provides a useful approach for characterizing biomes. We focus on the little-known succulent biome, a trans-continentally distributed assemblage of succulent-rich, drought-deciduous, fire-free forest, thicket and scrub vegetation as a useful exemplar biome to gain insights into these questions. Location Global lowland (sub)tropics. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Angiosperms. Methods We use a model ensemble approach to model the distribution of 884 species of stem succulents, a plant functional group representing a striking example of evolutionary convergence. Using this model, phylogenies, and species occurrence data, we quantify phylogenetic succulent biome conservatism for 10 non-succulent trans-continental plant clades including prominent elements of the succulent biome, representing over 800 species. Results The geographical and climatic distributions of stem succulents provide an objective and quantitative proxy for mapping the distribution of the succulent biome. High fractions of succulent biome occupancy across continents suggest all 10 non-succulent study clades are phylogenetically conserved within the succulent biome. Main conclusions The trans-continental succulent and savanna biomes both show evolutionary convergence in key biome-related plant functional traits. However, in contrast to the savanna biome, which was apparently assembled via repeated local recruitment of lineages via biome shifts from adjacent biomes within continents, the succulent biome forms a coherent trans-continental evolutionary arena for drought-adapted tropical biome conserved lineages. Recognizing the important functional differences between the succulent-rich, grass-poor, fire-free succulent biome and the grass-dominated, succulent-poor, fire-prone savanna biome, and defining them as distinct seasonally dry tropical biomes, occupying essentially non-overlapping distributions, provides critical insights into tropical biodiversity and the extent of biome stasis versus biome shifting.},

The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site dN/dS rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.},

Four types of models are being explored in the literature: (a) diffusion models, (b) island models, (c) hierarchical vicariance models (HVMs), and (d) reticulate models. Diffusion models are used primarily for phylogeographic inference but can also offer insights into geographic discontinuities of significance on longer time scales. For the island models, statistical approaches are now well developed and typically offer more detailed insight than parsimony analysis. In contrast, parsimony may still be the best option for HVM analysis, because existing statistical approaches do not yet accommodate dispersal. The proposed probabilistic models of reticulate scenarios remain poorly understood, even though they may currently do the best job of integrating diversification processes into biogeographic analysis.

This review investigates how environmental effects, particularly mechanical perturbation, can influence biomechanical development in self-supporting and climbing growth forms. The bifacial vascular cambium is discussed in terms of its significance to growth form variation, ecology and evolution among extant plants, and during its appearance and early evolution. A key aspect of this developmental innovation concerned its potential for architectural and mechanical variation in response to environmental effects as well as optimizing hydraulic supply before the appearance of laminate leaves. Growth form diversity and its importance to past and present ecosystems are discussed in relation to both evolutionary constraints and ecological factors such as climatic change and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We discuss how widely ranging growth forms such as climbers show a large range of developmental and phenotypic variation that has much to offer in understanding how the environment can modify plant development, particularly in terms of the bifacial vascular cambium. The broad approach we propose would benefit a wide range of studies from research into wood development to long-term ecological censuses of today's potentially changing ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Biogeography is the discipline of biology that studies the present and past distribution patterns of biological diversity and their underlying environmental and historical causes. For most of its history, biogeography has been divided into proponents of vicariance explanations, who defend that distribution patterns can mainly be explained by geological, tectonic-isolating events; and dispersalists, who argue that current distribution patterns are largely the result of recent migration events. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the discipline from methods focused on finding general patterns of distribution (cladistic biogeography), to those that integrate biogeographic processes (event-based biogeography), to modern probabilistic approaches (parametric biogeography). The latter allows incorporating into biogeographic inference estimates of the divergence time between lineages (usually based on DNA sequences) and external sources of evidence, such as information on past climate and geography, the organism fossil record, or its ecological tolerance. This has revolutionized the discipline, allowing it to escape the dispersal versus vicariance dilemma and to address a wider range of evolutionary questions, including the role of ecological and historical factors in the construction of biomes or the existence of contrasting patterns of range evolution in animals and plants.},

However, whether dispersal traits explain the distribution of pantropical plant groups remains unclear. Here we reconstruct the biogeographical history of a tree clade to assess whether seed dispersal traits and biome-switching explain the clade's pantropical distribution. Location Pantropical. Taxon The Pterocarpus clade (Leguminosae/Fabaceae). Methods We sequenced 303 nuclear loci using target capture and generated a time-calibrated phylogenomic tree. We also generated a corroborative time-calibrated phylogenetic tree from data-mined Sanger-sequencing data. We then collated distribution data and seed dispersal morphology traits to compare trait-dependent and trait-independent biogeographical models, allowing us to infer whether dispersal traits influenced Pterocarpus' spatio-temporal evolution. Finally, using the results of these model tests, we estimated the ancestral ranges and biomes of Pterocarpus species to better understand their biogeographical history, and assessed the degree and direction of biome-switching over the course of their diversification. Results We recovered well-supported phylogenetic relationships within Pterocarpus, within which there were two subclades \textendash{} one neotropical and the other palaeotropical. Our divergence date estimates suggested that Pterocarpus diversified from around 12 Ma, during the Miocene. Trait-dependent biogeographical models were rejected for both range and biome evolution within Pterocarpus, but models including dispersal were supported. Pterocarpus' ancestral node shared a range across the new-world and old-world tropics, followed by divergence into palaeotropical and neotropical clades. Biome-switching occurred most frequently into rainforest and grassland. Main conclusions Our analyses suggest that Pterocarpus underwent infrequent cross-continental dispersal and establishment into novel biomes. While this was minimally impacted by seed dispersal traits, biome-switching following long-distance dispersal and climate change have played an important role in diversification within Pterocarpus since the Miocene. Indeed, rare events of long-distance dispersal likely explain the wide distributions of many pantropical plant species.},

Mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of liana species diversity could yield new insights into the maintenance of overall species diversity. Lianas contribute to forest regeneration and competition, not only by competing directly with trees, but also by differentially affecting tree species and thus changing how trees compete among themselves. In addition, they contribute considerably to ecosystem-level processes, such as whole-forest transpiration and carbon sequestration. As the rate of tropical forest disturbance increases, they are likely to increase in relative abundance throughout the tropics and the importance of lianas to many aspects of forest dynamics will grow.},

Using data from 69 tropical forests worldwide, I demonstrate that liana (woody vine) abundance is correlated negatively with mean annual precipitation and positively with seasonality, a pattern precisely the opposite of most other plant types. I propose a general mechanistic hypothesis integrating both ecological and ecophysiological approaches to explain this pattern. Specifically, the deep root and efficient vascular systems of lianas enable them to suffer less water stress during seasonal droughts while many competitors are dormant, giving lianas a competitive advantage during the dry season. Testing this hypothesis in central Panama, I found that lianas grew approximately seven times more in height than did trees during the dry season but only twice as much during the wet season. Over time, this dry season advantage may allow lianas to increase in abundance in seasonal forests. In aseasonal wet forests, however, lianas gain no such advantage because competing plants are rarely limited by water. I extend this theory to account for the local, within-forest increase in liana abundance in response to disturbance as well as the conspicuous decrease in liana abundance at high latitudes.},

We unveil the evolutionary structure of tree species assemblages across the Americas to assess whether an inability to move or an inability to evolve is the predominant constraint in plant diversification and biogeography. We find a fundamental divide in tree lineage composition between tropical and extratropical environments, defined by the absence versus presence of freezing temperatures. Within the Neotropics, we uncover a further evolutionary split between moist and dry forests. Our results demonstrate that American tree lineages tend to retain their ancestral environmental relationships and that phylogenetic niche conservatism is the primary force structuring the distribution of tree biodiversity. Our study establishes the pervasive importance of niche conservatism to community assembly even at intercontinental scales.

  abstract = {La cellule constitue l'unit\'e de base de la vie. Pourtant les plus simples d'entre elles, les bact\'eries, poss\`edent une structure d'une extr\^eme complexit\'e et sont capables de comportements sophistiqu\'es. Les cellules eucaryotes sont encore plus complexes. De plus, compar\'ees aux cellules procaryotes, elles pr\'esentent une diversification fantastique au niveau morphologique et au niveau de l'organisation qu'elles adoptent : cellules isol\'ees, coloniales ou int\'egr\'ees et diff\'erenci\'ees dans un organisme pluricellulaire. Une question se pose : comment sont apparues les premi\`eres cellules eucaryotes ? Une chose certaine est qu'elles n'ont pu appara\^itre qu'\`a partir de pr\'ecurseurs simples. Nous n'aborderons pas dans ce livre en profondeur la question de savoir comment ces pr\'ecurseurs simples sont apparus. Nous aborderons plus sp\'ecifiquement le probl\`eme de comprendre comment la cellule eucaryote moderne a pu appara\^itre \`a partir de cellules plus simples et quels pr\'ecurseurs peut-on envisager. La cellule eucaryote, une fois apparue, a connu un grand succ\`es au cours de l'\'evolution et s'est diversifi\'ee dans une myriade d'organismes ayant des tailles similaires \`a celle des cellules bact\'eriennes (1-2 {$\mu$}m) jusqu'\`a des organismes aussi massifs que les baleines, les s\'equoias g\'eants ou les armillaires, champignons communs dont les myc\'eliums peuvent peser jusqu'\`a 2 000 tonnes ! Tr\`es souvent, la biodiversit\'e pr\'esent\'ee dans les cours ou manuels de biologie se r\'esume \`a celle des plantes et des animaux. Cependant, ces deux groupes biologiques ne repr\'esentent qu'une petite fraction de la diversit\'e biologique des eucaryotes. Celle-ci se voit plus sp\'ecialement dans des groupes d'organismes microscopiques ou avec une organisation simple que l'on regroupe sous le terme g\'en\'erique de "Protistes Eucaryotes", qui dans ce livre va prendre une acceptation au sens large, car regroupant tous les organismes qui ne sont clairement ni des animaux (eum\'etazoaires), ni des plantes sup\'erieures (embryophytes). L'analyse de ces protistes montre que la dichotomie ancienne animal/v\'eg\'etal n'a pas de sens biologique et est progressivement remplac\'ee par une classification plus en ad\'equation avec ce que l'on sait de l'\'evolution de la cellule eucaryote. C'est cette classification phylog\'en\'etique qui est suivie dans ce livre. Lorsqu'est \'evoqu\'e le terme de microbe, qui veut dire organisme invisible \`a l'oeil nu, souvent ce mot est restreint aux bact\'eries et aux virus (qui ne sont pourtant pas \`a proprement parl\'e de vrais organismes vivants, mais c'est un autre d\'ebat). Ceux-ci ont pris une telle ampleur dans les cours universitaires que parfois, les microbes eucaryotes ne sont m\^eme pas \'evoqu\'es ! Il existe en effet de nombreux trait\'es de microbiologie dans lesquels, il semblerait que seules les bact\'eries aient le droit d'appara\^itre. C'est bien dommage car aussi bien au niveau du fonctionnement de la biosph\`ere que de la sant\'e et des industries humaines, les microbes eucaryotes ont une importance cruciale, parfois bien sup\'erieure \`a celle des bact\'eries et des virus. Ce livre propose de corriger cette tendance, en expliquant quelques-unes des caract\'eristiques des protistes eucaryotes. Le terme microbe n'est en effet pas compl\`etement appropri\'e pour ces organismes dont certains sont bien visible \`a l'oeil nu... Ce livre prend sa source dans les cours que je professe depuis plus de quinze ans \`a la maitrise, maintenant le master 1, de Biochimie de l'Universit\'e Paris Diderot. J'esp\`ere qu'il servira de ressources pour les nombreux coll\`egues qui comme moi enseignent la microbiologie, mais aussi aux \'etudiants qui dans le futur ne devraient plus ignorer le monde fascinant des protistes.

  abstract = {A recent controversy concerns whether plant traits that are assumed to be adaptations to fire originally evolved in response to selective factors other than fire. We contribute to this debate by investigating the evolution of the endemic woody flora of the fire-prone Cerrado of central Brazil, the most species-rich savanna in the world. We review evidence from dated phylogenies and show that Cerrado lineages started to diversify less than 10 million years ago. These Cerrado lineages are characterized by fire-resistant traits such as thick, corky bark and root sprouting, which have been considered to have evolved as adaptations to drought or nutrient-deficient soils. However, the fact that the lineages carrying these features arose coincident with the rise to dominance of flammable C4 grasses and expansion of the savanna biome worldwide, and postdating the earlier origin of seasonal climates and the nutrient-poor, acid Cerrado soils suggests that such traits should be considered as adaptations to fire regimes. The nature of these features as adaptations to fire is further suggested by their absence or poor development in related lineages found in fire-free environments with similar edaphic conditions to the Cerrado and by their repeated independent origin in diverse lineages. We present evidence to demonstrate that the evolutionary barrier to entry to the Cerrado is a weak one, presumably because of the ease of evolution of the necessary adaptations to fire regimes for lineages inhabiting neighboring fire-free biomes.},

A molecular phylogeny of the species-rich and morphologically and ecologically diverse genus Mimosa was generated to evaluate its infrageneric classification, reconstruct the evolution of a set of morphological characters, and establish the relationships of Old World species to the rest of the genus. \textbullet{} Methods: We used trnD-trnT plastid sequences for 259 species of Mimosa (ca. 50\% of the total) to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus. Six morphological characters (petiolar nectary, inflorescence type, number of stamens, number of petals, pollen type, and seismonasty) were optimized onto the molecular tree. \textbullet{} Key results: Mimosa was recovered as a monophyletic clade nested within the Piptadenia group and includes the former members of Schrankia, corroborating transfer of that genus to Mimosa. Although we found good support for several infrageneric groups, only one section (Mimadenia) was recovered as monophyletic. All but one of the morphological characters analyzed showed high levels of homoplasy. High levels of geographic structure were found, with species from the same area tending to group together in the phylogeny. Old World species of Mimosa form a monophyletic clade deeply nested within New World groups, indicating recent (6\textendash 10 Ma) long-distance dispersal. \textbullet{} Conclusions: Although based on a single plastid region, our results establish a preliminary phylogenetic framework for Mimosa that can be used to infer patterns of morphological evolution and relationships and which provides pointers toward a revised infrageneric classification.},

Its high species richness and recent diversification only c. 6 million years ago have significantly complicated previous phylogenetic analyses. Several basic elements of Manihot evolutionary history therefore remain unresolved. Here, we conduct a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of Manihot, focusing on exhaustive sampling of South American taxa. We find that two recently described species from northeast Brazil's Atlantic Forest were the earliest to diverge, strongly suggesting a South American common ancestor of Manihot. Ancestral state reconstruction indicates early Manihot diversification in dry forests, with numerous independent episodes of new habitat colonization, including into savannas and rainforests within South America. We identify the closest wild relatives to Manihot esculenta, including the crop cassava, and we quantify extensive wild introgression into the cassava gene pool from at least five wild species, including Manihot glaziovii, a species used widely in breeding programs. Finally, we show that this wild-to-crop introgression substantially shapes the mutation load in cassava. Our findings provide a detailed case study for neotropical evolutionary history in a diverse and widespread group, and a robust phylogenomic framework for future Manihot and cassava research.},

For several large angiosperm clades (Angiospermae, Monocotyledonae, Orchidaceae, Poaceae, Eudicotyledonae, Fabaceae, and Asteraceae), we explore this issue by contrasting two approaches: (1) using small backbone trees with an inferred number of extant species assigned to each terminal clade and (2) using a mega-phylogeny of 55473 seed plant species represented in GenBank. The mega-phylogeny approach assumes that the sample of species in GenBank is at least roughly proportional to the actual species diversity of different lineages, as appears to be the case for many major angiosperm lineages. Using both approaches, we found that diversification rate shifts are not directly associated with the major named clades examined here, with the sole exception of Fabaceae in the GenBank mega-phylogeny. These agreements are encouraging and may support a generality about angiosperm evolution: major shifts in diversification may not be directly associated with major named clades, but rather with clades that are nested not far within these groups. An alternative explanation is that there have been increased extinction rates in early-diverging lineages within these clades. Based on our mega-phylogeny, the shifts in diversification appear to be distributed quite evenly throughout the angiosperms. Mega-phylogenetic studies of diversification hold great promise for revealing new patterns, but we will need to focus more attention on properly specifying null expectation.},

Dispersal syndrome was classified as anemochory, barochory, and zoochory. We recorded a higher number of lianas species in Chajul (128 spp.) than in Chamela (71 spp.). In both sites, families with the highest number of species were Bignoniaceae, Leguminosae, Sapindaceae, and Malphigiaceae, and almost half of the liana species had inconspicuous flowers. Most of the species had an abiotic syndrome of dispersal with 40 (56.3\%) and 71 (55.5\%) wind-dispersed species in Chamela and Chajul, respectively. Zoochory was significantly associated with inconspicuous flowers and anemochory with conspicuous flowers. Our results suggest that (1) flower morphology and dispersal type are not related with the amount of rainfall and (2) lianas are more prone to be wind-dispersed.},

We also suggest that "climbing plant" or "climber" be used to describe plants displaying the climbing habit, and "liana" and "vine" be left for describing woody and herbaceous climbers respectively. As for climbing mechanisms, we propose an eight-category classification comprised of two major categories: passive climbing, containing scrambling, hooks or grapnels, and adhesive roots; and active climbing, containing twining, tendrils, prehensile branches, twining petioles, and twining inflorescences.},

With the largest phylogeny yet compiled for grasses, we present an example of a key physiological innovation that promoted high diversification rates. C4 photosynthesis, a complex suite of traits that improves photosynthetic efficiency under conditions of drought, high temperatures, and low atmospheric CO2, has evolved repeatedly in one lineage of grasses and was consistently associated with elevated diversification rates. In most cases there was a significant lag time between the origin of the pathway and subsequent radiations, suggesting that the `C4 effect' is complex and derives from the interplay of the C4 syndrome with other factors. We also identified comparable radiations occurring during the same time period in C3 Pooid grasses, a diverse, cold-adapted grassland lineage that has never evolved C4 photosynthesis. The mid to late Miocene was an especially important period of both C3 and C4 grass diversification, coincident with the global development of extensive, open biomes in both warm and cool climates. As is likely true for most ``key innovations'', the C4 effect is context dependent and only relevant within a particular organismal background and when particular ecological opportunities became available.},

There is good evidence to support both hypotheses, including a new analysis of data from Ghana. In this dataset, there is a linear increase in the percentage of species that are lianas, from 30\% at a mean annual rainfall of 2,000~mm year-1 to 43\% at a mean annual rainfall of 1,000~mm year-1. Both trends in lianas, one temporal, the other spatial, may be related to water availability, though parallel changes in canopy density (disturbance) may be contributory. It is also clear that most liana species in West Africa show restricted distribution along the rainfall gradient implying adaptation to different water availability. The reasons for the high sensitivity to rainfall may be that lianas have an especially effective water-transport system, with deep roots, large xylem vessels and a mechanism to avoid cavitation of water. As the climate of much of the tropics is becoming drier, we may expect increases in both liana abundance and their proportion in the flora over the future decades.},

Furthermore, these products provide important baseline data for the development of sustainable management strategies to local stakeholders. The use of remote sensing data can provide spatially explicit information of AGB from local to global scales. In this study, we mapped national Mexican forest AGB using satellite remote sensing data and a machine learning approach. We modelled AGB using two scenarios: (1) extensive national forest inventory (NFI), and (2) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) as reference data. Finally, we propagated uncertainties from field measurements to LiDAR-derived AGB and to the national wall-to-wall forest AGB map.},

A previous study detected two plastid genomic variations in this subfamily, but the limited taxon sampling left the overall plastid genome (plastome) diversification across the subfamily unaddressed, and phylogenetic relationships within this clade remained unresolved. Here, we assembled eight plastomes from seven Cercidoideae genera and conducted phylogenomic-comparative analyses in a broad evolutionary framework across legumes. The plastomes of Cercidoideae all exhibited a typical quadripartite structure with a conserved gene content typical of most angiosperm plastomes. Plastome size ranged from 151,705 to 165,416 bp, mainly due to the expansion and contraction of inverted repeat (IR) regions. The order of genes varied due to the occurrence of several inversions. In Tylosema species, a plastome with a 29-bp IR-mediated inversion was found to coexist with a canonical-type plastome, and the abundance of the two arrangements of isomeric molecules differed between individuals. Complete plastome data were much more efficient at resolving intergeneric relationships of Cercidoideae than the previously used selection of only a few plastid or nuclear loci. In sum, our study revealed novel insights into the structural diversification of plastomes in an early-branching legume lineage, and, thus, into the evolutionary trajectories of legume plastomes in general.},

Both disjunct patterns have multiple times of origin. The amphitropical disjunctions have largely resulted from long-distance dispersal, primarily from the Miocene to the Holocene, with available data indicating that most lineages dispersed from North to South America. Results of recent studies on the Mediterranean disjuncts between the deserts of Eurasia and western North America support the multiple modes of origin and are mostly consistent with hypotheses of long-distance dispersal and the North Atlantic migration. Axelrod's Madrean\textendash Tethyan hypothesis, which implies vicariance between the two regions in the early Tertiary, has been favored by a few studies. The Beringian migration corridor for semiarid taxa is also supported in some cases.},

Both historical biogeographers and ecologists have more-or-less abandoned attempts to understand the processes that determine the large-scale distribution of clades. Here, we describe the chasm that has developed between ecology and historical biogeography, some of the important questions that have fallen into it and how it might be bridged.

We focus specifically on how niche conservatism in climatic tolerances may limit geographic range expansion and how this one type of niche conservatism may be important in (a) allopatric speciation, (b) historical biogeography, (c) patterns of species richness, (d) community structure, (e) the spread of invasive, human-introduced species, (f) responses of species to global climate change, and (g) human history, from 13,000 years ago to the present.

  abstract = {Biogeography and community ecology can mutually illuminate the formation of a regional species pool or biome. Here, we apply phylogenetic methods to a large and diverse plant clade, Malpighiaceae, to characterize the formation of its species pool in Mexico, and its occupancy of the seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) biome that occurs there. We find that the \textasciitilde 162 species of Mexican Malpighiaceae represent \textasciitilde 33 dispersals from South America beginning in the Eocene and continuing until the Pliocene (\textasciitilde 46.4\textendash 3.8 Myr). Furthermore, dispersal rates between South America and Mexico show a significant six-fold increase during the mid-Miocene (\textasciitilde 23.9 Myr). We hypothesize that this increase marked the availability of Central America as an important corridor for Neotropical plant migration. We additionally demonstrate that this high rate of dispersal contributed substantially more to the phylogenetic diversity of Malpighiaceae in Mexico than in situ diversification. Finally, we show that most lineages arrived in Mexico pre-adapted with regard to one key SDTF trait, total annual precipitation. In contrast, these lineages adapted to a second key trait, precipitation seasonality, in situ as mountain building in the region gave rise to the abiotic parameters of extant SDTF. The timing of this in situ adaptation to seasonal precipitation suggests that SDTF likely originated its modern characteristics by the late Oligocene, but was geographically more restricted until its expansion in the mid-Miocene. These results highlight the complex interplay of dispersal, adaptation, and in situ diversification in the formation of tropical biomes. Our results additionally demonstrate that these processes are not static, and their relevance can change markedly over evolutionary time. This has important implications for understanding the origin of SDTF in Mexico, but also for understanding the temporal and spatial origin of biomes and regional species pools more broadly.},

A better understanding of this variability is necessary for more accurate predictions of the future climate\textendash carbon cycle feedback. Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy\textendash covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained {$>$}90\% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000\textendash 2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r2 = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r2 = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy\textendash covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.},

  abstract = {The growth, morphology and biomass allocation of 11 liana species (six light-demanding and five shade-tolerant) were investigated by growing plants in three contrasting light environments (i.e., field, forest edge and forest interior). Our objectives were to determine: (1) changes in plant traits at the species level; and (2) differences in light-demanding and shade-tolerant species in response to altered light environment. We found that all seedlings of liana species increased in total biomass, total leaf area, relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), height, basal diameter, root length, leaf number, root mass/total plant mass (RMR) and root-to-shoot dry biomass (R/S ratio), and decreased in leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf size, stem mass-to-total plant mass ratio (SMR) and leaf mass-to-total plant mass ratio (LMR) with increasing light availability. Under the three light environments, the two types of species differed significantly in total biomass, total leaf area, RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and leaf number, and not in leaf area. Only light-demanding species differed significantly in height, root length, basal diameter, RMR, SMR, LMR and R/S ratio. The mean plasticity index of growth and biomass allocation were relatively higher than the morphological variables, with significant differences between the two groups. Our results showed that liana species respond differently to changing light environments and that light-demanding species exhibit higher plasticity. Such differences may affect the relative success of liana species in forest dynamics.},

  abstract = {Aim To quantify evolutionary transitions between tropical evergreen rain forest and seasonally dry biomes, to test whether biome transitions affect lineage diversification and to examine the robustness of these results to methodological choices. Location The tropics. Time period The Cenozoic. Major taxa studied The plant subfamily Bombacoideae (Malvaceae). Methods We inferred ancestral biomes based on a fossil-dated molecular phylogeny of 103 species (59\% of the clade) and recorded the number of transitions among biomes using biogeographical stochastic mapping based on the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis model. We then estimated diversification rates using state-specific speciation and extinction rate (SSE) methods. Furthermore, we tested the sensitivity of the results to model choice, phylogenetic uncertainty, measurement error and biome definition. Results We found numerous transitions from evergreen rain forest to seasonally dry biomes, and fewer in the opposite direction. These results were robust to methodological choices. Biome type did not influence diversification rates, although this result was subject to uncertainty, especially related to model choice and biome definition. Main conclusions Our results contradict the idea of evolutionary biome conservatism in Bombacoideae, and support previous findings that evergreen rain forests serve as a source for the flora of seasonally dry biomes. The impact of biome classification and biome definition on the results suggest caution when using a biome concept for biogeographical reconstruction and diversification rate analysis.},

  abstract = {We assessed the influence of species phylogenetic relatedness on the interaction between woody climbing plants (lianas) and their host trees (phorophytes). Considering that closely related species tend to have similar niches, we expected (1) closely related lianas to co-occur in similar phorophyte sets and (2) original lianas (phylogenetically distinct lianas with unique set of features) to occur on distinct phorophyte sets. We sampled three highly diverse forest sites in SE Brazil (a tropical rainforest, a savanna woodland and a tropical semideciduous forest), and sought for (1) a phylogenetic signal in liana climbing traits; (2) a phylogenetic signal in the liana-phorophyte interaction by testing the correlation between (a) phylogenetic distances and similarity of interacting species sets and (b) the species phylogenetic originality and the number of their interactions; and (3) a positive relationship between phylogenetic originality and the specificity of liana-phorophyte interactions. We found a phylogenetic signal in climbing systems of liana species. In the semideciduous forest, we observed that closely related lianas share similar phorophyte sets, and original lianas occur on a small number of phorophyte species. However, when we evaluated the interactions of species with high originality, we found an opposing pattern in forests and savanna. In forests, the phylogenetically original liana species co-occurred more frequently with very distinct phorophyte sets; whereas in the savanna woodland, the phylogenetically original liana species co-occurred conversely with common phorophyte sets. We argued that environmental differences in forests and savannas could have mediated different tree morphological traits, such as bark characteristics, which might structure different liana-phorophyte interactions.},
